The way you phrased this makes it sound like it's a simple option. If so, then bravo, and I approve. If not, then ugh. I mean I hate DLC like this as well, but they've also given the community many content updates, free of charge as well. It's more of locking out a part of the update you are *forced to see*. It's different if you just don't see it and it's extra content. I'd also assume they would rather do that than gate the community based on DLC, hence why people are saying Payday handles it well, as in letting you play with people who have the content, but you can't host it your self or get the weapons from it. Payday sounds like the right idea. If *one person* owns the content, then everyone in the game that's playing with them can access it freely. Once that person leaves, no more DLC stuff. But the helicopter thing sounds like bullshit. You *have* to see the helicopter, since it's there. And you can't fly it unless you pay. That's fucked up.

I'd also recommend Eon by Greg Bear, that book is *extremely* thought provoking. He also writes good short stories.

      "I understand where you're coming from, OP, but I do think it's worthwhile to cultivate a greater understanding of why this trope exists rather than dismiss it out of hand as women being self-destructive. In your examples of why Harry Potter is different from the standard female romance protagonist, you sort of miss the point that the reason Harry Potter is FRAMED in a different way is that men and women are encouraged to experience different power fantasies. Men are socially encouraged to fantasize about possessing power (for themselves and to protect those they care about) whereas women are socially encouraged to fantasize about being possessed by a powerful person. As a lesbian who has also had a freelance gig writing heterosexual romance, I get it. I'm not saying that internalized misogyny is a good thing, or that unhealthy manifestations of heteronormative gender expectations are helping anyone. It's guilty pleasure reading on par with your typical self-indulgent John Green wish fulfillment novel about an introverted nerd and a manic pixie dream girl. That said, I'm firmly in the camp of people who believe that there needs to be a whole lot more healthy relationship representation out there, because books like Twilight do seem to influence how many women form expectations about relationships. I have had bi women tell me they would never consider being in a serious relationship with a woman because they want to be the only emotional one and want someone who can throw them against a wall. On one hand, I think it's important to have fiction we can access for therapeutic reasons. On the other, I'd like to see a little less cultural brainwashing on the part of popular fiction oriented toward boys and girls alike. And now, an obligatory suggestion to check out Sarah Waters. She's a lesbian writer but her books are heart-stoppingly exciting. I highly recommend The Fingersmith (Bret Easton Ellis has said this is his favorite book of all time) and Tipping the Velvet.\n",

So in that case all their post was saying was that you don't have to respect people if you don't want to...? Which is kind of a given haha... so idk what exactly they were getting at there. But then again, that still doesn't make sense because IRL you are always forced to work with people you don't respect, and you still have to pretend to respect them. It really doesn't matter how you feel about it. Yeah I really don't know what they're trying to say :/ That person made a commitment, then made a conscious decision to cheat. Oh yeah I feel that way too. I'm just saying in some couples one member cheats and the other chooses to forgive them. Maybe cheating is a bad example. One member f***s up royally and the other forgives them, and that doesn't have to do with either person's individual merit, I'm saying it's a choice. Basically the level of respect and trust you afford to other people is your personal choice, but the way OP described it was like it's an obvious scale that if someone is disrespectful you automatically lose respect for them, which is not really the case. I struggle with these things as I try to be religious and so I'm not supposed to hate anyone :P As I was saying above though, I think everyone has a threshold of respect for other humans, that even if you screw everything up you will still afford them that threshold. Some people's thresholds are just higher than others. I personally spend my life trying to raise my threshold for respecting other people, rather than trying to justify why I hate the people around me. But that's all a choice I guess.\n",

However, the central theme as for the reasons why Asian women prefer white men seems to based around white Supremacy. My Asian homies pointed out how you'd see ugly or not physically attractive white dudes with Asian women, guys who would have no chance with women of other races, but due to Asian women putting whiteness on a pedestal, find those type of white guys attractive. Like they said those white guys couldn't pull a bomb white girl, couldn't pull a bomb Latina girl, or a bomb black girl, but you'd see them with a decently attractive Asian girl.

I laugh my ass off whenever someone complains about just how racist and xenophobic he is. You're playing right into his cards. If the media had been focused more on his actual platform than on whatever shit he spewed at a rally, this would been a totally different election cycle. It is also mildly annoying to hear people rave on about how stupid or ignorant Trump is. I may concede ignorant if he truly believes everything he says but I'm actually convinced that most of it is just a planned effort to get air time. Again, he has to be outrageous to be in the spot light. I'm more concerned about the extremist faction of Trump's supporters who actually believe him when he says the election is rigged and that he won't accept the result if he loses. It's bullshit. Trump isn't interested in the presidency as much as he's interested in the prestige that comes with holding the office. When he has lost on November 8th, he's going to slowly abandon politics, probably trying to capitalize on the extremist wing of his 'movement' and sell them all sorts of conspiracies, similar to Alex Jones. Trump is the ultimate troll and it doesn't speak in favor of the electorate that he has come so far.\n",

For whom it is literally a casual interest. So, you have a *casual* interest in truth that you can't explain. Got it. I think maybe some more introspection on that level would move things along for you. I certainly benefitted from it. I remember what my mind was like before 9/11. Much, much more docile and much, much less awake, willing to believe whatever They (the media, think tanks, anyone with an agenda) tell me to believe. It just doesn't seem plausible at least not for something like a niche subreddit. Two things. First, the reality of something is not defined by whether you can wrap your mind around it. It is not the *plausibility* of something that determines if it is a fact (think: do you find X-rays *plausibile*? I mean, they *sound* ridiculous to me). No. It is defined by patterns, behaviours of others, and the facts surrounding the issue. This is all I'm allegiant to. If the facts supported 'zero point energy' and 'lizards in the whitehouse,' then that's what I'd believe. many people who (like me) for some reason (I can't explain it) seem to somewhat enjoy debating these types of things Second, look at the linguistic construct in the above sentence. You are clearly aware of the hidden truths behind what we are talking about over in /r/Conspiracy, but you're unable to put it directly into words using active verbs, active voice, to say it directly. **It just doesn't seem plausible** to you. But for me, I can explain it. I know the reason I'm here. I walked home across the Brooklyn Bridge, covered in dust, just like the rest of the plebs that day. I know what motivates me to debate these types of things. **So do you**you just haven't articulated it to yourself, yet. Question: If we're BOTH in a prison camp, how could it matter which one of us admits that we're in the prison camp? The reality is independent of how we choose to integrate our experiences. I am not smarter or wiser than you are. The more we discuss our motivations, the more we realize that we are in the same place. Our differences of thought and opinion are only temporal. I am not arguing Ayn Rand or conservative theory with you or something, here. There is a **reality** underneath this one that affects BOTH our daily lives. Myself, I have faced up to the truth of our slavery *now*, right now. Where are you? Still clinging to the laudable and yes, wonderful idea that no, no way, our governments aren't out to hurt us, and *haha*, there's no evidence of a 'shadow government' at work out there (that **$52B black budget( just goes nowhere, right?), right? But you KNOW that's not the truth. Me, I faced the truth today. What will it take for you to face those same truths? When the government comes for your guns? When Wall St. (which, let's face it, is the same as the government) comes for your job, your home, your factory, your family, or your freedoms (in the form of indefinite detention)? Being powerless bothers you. I get that. But true power comes from refusing to accept that others tell you you are powerless. You ARE powerful. Knowledge is power. So fuck the shi-lls, the aliens, the HAARP, all the bullshit. Yeah, there's some stupid shit out there. But our common ground is that we don't have to take this shit anymore.

      "They are brand new drugs like I said. Quillivant XR is a 20% Instant Release Methylphenidate drug, 80% Extended Release Methylphenidate that lasts up to 12 hours. The closest drug release curve to a pill capsule tablet would probably be Concerta which is a 10 to 12 hour medicine with 22% Instant Release and 78% Extended Release See drug release curve here for quillivant xr this is a picture of which hours of the day the drug is the strongest highest levels are in your blood. Concerta Drug release curve here which compares Concerta to 3 times a day Ritalin IR Metadate CD and Ritalin LA are stronger in the morning than Concerta and Quillivant XR and last 8 to 10 hours. Ritalin LA is even stronger in the morning than Metadate CD. This is because Ritalin LA activates 50% of its medicine instantly and 50% later, Metadate CD does 30% of its medicine instantly and 70% later, Concerta does 22% of its medicine instantly and 78% later, and Quillivant XR does 20% of its medicine instantly and 80% later -------     Like I said before Dynavel XR just hit the market within the last year (April 2016). It is very like Adderall XR but in liquid extended release form. ---- I imagine most doctors don't prescribe them, but I guess it's worth asking about. Unless you need the ability to bypass swallowing a med (such as a chewable tablet, a dissolving tablet on your tongue, or an extended release liquid) than many of these new med formulations will not benefit you. It is a similar med to what is already out just in a different way to get into your body. But if you are a young kid who has problems swallowing pills, or if you are a patient that wants more control over the amount of med you get per day and per hour and your doctor is okay with this then you should ask them about these slight variants of existing ADHD meds. I can list even more variants besides the liquid extended release stimulants but most people will not benefit and I will just ramble =P Here is a short table version though that will not explain all the benefits but let you be aware that there are many options already here or in development Table of Methylphenidate meds already approved and in development Table of Amphetamine meds already approved but also more in development Note this table is wonderful but there is a minor error, Evekeo is a 1:1 ratio of D-AMP to L-AMP (50% D-AMP to 50% L-AMP) and not a 3:1 ratio of D-AMP to L-AMP (75% D-AMP to 25% L-AMP) the 3:1 ratio is the ratio Adderall uses. Evekeo's big deal and marketing strategy is that it is currently the only med with 50% L-AMP vs other amphetamine products which have 25% or 0% L-AMP. I need to remember to e-mail the journal article writers to correct this error in their recently published article.\n",

I identify a lot. Except I believe everyone is just one conversation away being permanently protected from being seduced by amorality. For that, I give hope, I remind people of their successes, I tell them about their strengths. I help them building themselves a solid ethical framework, to be able to keep the direction, even when they face a tempest. I do that because I'm aware of my own lack of such. I do that because I seem good despite no one having ever done that for me. I'm sure you'll be able to be such person for someone else. It worth the work. And you worth it.\n",

The *new* Zelda for Wii U also has a high tech bow. Oh, and the lasers from these guys IMO it looks like magic intertwined with technology. But Zelda's been littered with the stuff nonetheless. I see the Robots as an extension of that. Just way back in the past before most of the tech was destroyed. And it gave us a reason why it's seemingly littered around the series. In terms of story, we see in PH and ST that they are finally building back up the technology, but it's based on the same roots: magic. Magic mixed with tech, and that's really how it's always been with Zelda. But the focus has mostly been on the magic. With SS, the focus shifted a bit back over to the tech side.\n",

We've been together nearly four years now and he's just consistently positive. I'm lucky to have met him. Before I was just floating on my own, as most INFJ typically do. He says he's certain I'm an INFJ because I'm mysterious. -cry laugh emoji lmao- We've never played mind games with each other. Everything is brought to the table because I require that in my relationships, and he appreciates it, because it actually alleviates his anxiety when we talk. My Fe is much... sharper than his; his is still gentle, caring, and nervous. Mine is more demanding. I demand emotional labour, demand considerateness, and demand social politeness (okay, I say demand, but really it's just like I'd *like* to have people meet me half-way on those things). This is also because I was raised largely by a very vocal, dominant ESTP mom, whereas his mom--surprise surprise--is also an INFJ, so she was more of the quiet, constant support-type. He's a very mature INFJ, whereas I *know* I fall into loop behaviour often.\n",

However, just because you have felt an emotional connection to something doesn't mean that there's no way you could be a thinking type! As I mentioned earlier INTPs have the function of extroverted feeling, which a lot of your statements seem to line up with more than introverted feeling (for example: there is nothing more meaningful in this world than really understanding how another person is feeling.) As someone else on here said you can't actually change MBTI types so I'd recommend reading up more on the differences between INFP/INTP and considering where you fall.

Heterosexuality is considered normal, and unless you're a heterosexual who spends time in spaces where atypical sexualities are discussed, you're unlikely to even encounter the concept of demisexuality.

      "I just skimmed that, but I saw *nothing* but rambling rhetoric that never actually explained why Hillary is a conservative apart from a few phrases tossed here and there, like: Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, something that conservatives, by definition, are supposed to uphold. Which is ridiculous, because the phrase the candidate of the status quo can be applied to virtually any candidate whose party holds the White House at the time of the election, i.e. Clinton is only being called the status quo candidate because she's following Barack Obama another Democrat. Obviously she'll continue down the same course Obama is continuing down, and that isn't inherently conservative. Clinton represents progress. Slow progress, yes, but progress nonetheless. Trump's policies, while dramatic, are regressive, not progressive. I mean, you could go back to the 40s and call Truman the candidate of the status quo because he followed FDR. Does that mean he was conservative? Fuck no. Apart from that, it just rambles about how unqualified she is, bringing up stupid shit like emails.

Falling off the disk if you take any falling damage is a good way to balance it as this is not a parachute, it's a magical hovering skateboard.

Edit for this section: If you had a telescope with zero angular momentum, surly this would have applications in determining the shape of the universe, or where we are in the universe by tracking the minute changes of the stars' angular separation. Like, you wouldn't have to measure these changes with respect to another object, but to absolute space itself. Why isn't there a relationship with gravity? Gravity pulls in, centripetal, rotating objects push out, centrifugal. Could you spin an object with certain mass fast enough that its centrifugal force overcomes the force of gravity? If so, is this anti-gravity?\n",

      "These 361 possible moves are quickly reduced to 55 possible moves You're right, and I thought about clarifying that, but the symmetry breaks down almost immediately in the first couple of moves, so I didn't think it was worth getting in to. (Honestly, I didn't think you would think of that and was hoping to just blow past it :P) But yeah, ultimately it's kind of irrelevant. If the first move is played along the center axes or the long diagonal axes, the symmetry is reduced by half, otherwise by 1/4, etc. There's usually no symmetry left after the first 2-3 moves, and you're right back up to 358-359 possible *distinct* moves. If 9x9 go were played competitively (which would be silly because it's probably able to be mastered), then I am sure some opening theories would become very prominent very quickly and the game could become a bit more chess-like. Possibly. It's unlikely it'll ever become competitive though, if anything we'll see boards get bigger. A number of top pros play informal games on boards as big as 21-27. And there are other variations such as 2-board go, where you play on two boards, but you only get one move between them per turn. In other words, when it's your turn, you can play on one board or the other, but not both, and then it's your opponents turn to do the same. In principle it doesn't change anything about the game because you already have locality to deal with in a normal 1 board game, so even then, you have to choose which fire you want to put out (or start). It's an interesting variation. So yeah, I highly doubt we'll ever see competitive 9x9 go. And 9x9 go is widely accepted as being more chess-like because everything is pretty much local and there is no room for larger strategy. It's a microcosm of go in that it's all about life and death, which in a 19x19 game, life and death problems are just a small part of the strategy. But can the experienced player point out specific, certainly unavoidable consequences of playing (5,7) as a first move? Definitely. The move is too far from the corners or sides to prevent an invasion underneath, so it has no potential to create territory. It has some potential in the corner, but no more so than just playing at 4,4 or 3,4 in the first place, and it puts black a move behind if he's just going to grab the corner anyway.

Education of the global populace would become a priority as the ability to synthesize *anything* would render economic systems obsolete, since resources would no longer be scarce. People could simply live, learn, explore the universe. ... Nuts, I know.\n",

      "Now that's a really good question. There's a wealth of information out there on Google, but it's hard to know what to trust. In the end you can only trust your ears, so I suggest getting out there and listening to as much as you can. I started with headphones, and it's definitely a good jumping off point. It's a LOT cheaper to get ridiculously high quality sound reproduction from headphones than speakers. Not to mention you don't have to worry about room acoustics or neighbors complaining. The Audio Technica ATH-M50s are pretty universally praised for their quality, and for about $100-$150 they are a pretty good bet for your first venture into great audio. I personally have a pair that I use in my studio for recording, and they're really great for revealing tons of detail in your favorite songs that you likely never heard before. Once you start getting excited by that, then you're hooked. But like I said, I would go out and try for yourself as much as you can before buying anything.\n",

      "Mangas have still panels so the artist can concentrate completely on how it's going to look. OPM has a very intense, vivid and detailed look that is rare in anime to see because the extra shading and lines would take a lot more time to draw and color as well in animation which is done frame by frame. And as we know anime is 24 frames even if they do everything to improvise a workaround to do like 6,8 or 12 frames if possible. And in this case they also need a lot of in between frames in order to convey the intensity and vividness putting even more strain on the key animators and giving extra work to the coloring crew. Basically yes, I don't believe that the anime can even hope to match the manga's vivid detail, but I can hope that they give this to a passionate director who understands said vividness and can convey it through cinematography.\n",

      "Who ever said anything about the perfect job opportunity? Well obviously you did, and I just repeated you saying it. But I certainly never said anything of the sort. So maybe it's you who is the idealist here. Also, I certainly never said anything about not doing mundane work. Again, it's you who seem to be doing the stuff that you're complaining about, not me. And I have no argument. I'm just explaining what it's like to be an INTP, from my own perspective. we were discussing the lack of pleasing (relatively speaking) jobs to choose from I was never talking about that. That was all you. I was talking about jobs that one hates, compared to the almost infinite number of other options for what one can do for work, not all pleasant, but also not ones that are hated. I guess you're not really interested in my perspective here, and you just want to project your own unconscious ideas onto me to bash them around a bit. You are really arguing with yourself here, without much need for me, except as a way to see yourself a bit better, while pretending it's someone else, who won't get you in trouble when others judge you. It sounds like you have a huge amount of yourself that's been repressed by the voices that have come in from the outside world that tell you what you should and shouldn't be and do. It's clearly causing you a whole lot of stress and anger and frustration and inner conflict. So getting that repressed stuff out and expressing your deeper beliefs about your own life and ideals/goals, might be good for everyone. We call them male because they have a dick between their legs. Heh. Except that's certainly not the case for many folks, who are bothered by the idea of transgender and mixed-gender types, who may look or sound or have been born looking like they had a penis, but don't. Maleness isn't really a thing, it's at best a fuzzy blob of different genes, behaviors, cultural norms, and so on. We even assign genders to inanimate objects like cars, boats, computers, robots, and stuffed animals, so clearly there're no real rules for what male means. But for the most part, we generally agree whether a human is male or not, and except for the blurry boundaries, that works well, in the same way as the 16 personality types of the MBTI are reasonably understandable and useful for general sorting purposes. It's just that while male is something that even tiny human children hear about fairly consistently, the MBTI is obscure and almost never used in the way that really is effective or clear. So it's no surprise that nearly everyone is confused about what an ISTJ is compared to an ENTP. Going to tell me INTPs can't follow mainstream religions now? Yep. INTP's are the most rebellious types out there when it comes to social norms and traditions. But because of that Perceiving, spiritual woo woo element, we also are happy to value those who do cling to someone else's ideas of social norms and traditions, and we even are happy to take anything that seems useful out of them to recombine with all the other useful stuff from around the universe to make something new and actually excellent for approaching life. Feeling and Judging types are the ones who are most traditional and focused on seeking guidance from a single, trusted, source (a group or individual) to tell them how things work, either in a scientific field, or a religious one. I'm pretty sure the specific case of having empathy for everyone isn't limited to type. That's pretty much literally the second person dimension. Those with low empathy (low estrogen) are the Sensing types, and those with high empathy (high estrogen) are the iNtuiting types, which is why they are said to have intuition and are able to know what someone else is feeling, without having to consciously and methodically analyze the more material/sensory/superficial evidence before making an educated guess about what others want to do.\n",

Women in their early 20's, more than women in their 30's, tend to be lost, confused, have poor judgment and shallow priorities. They tend to lack confidence and have less ability to correlate action with consequence. They also haven't made all the mistakes yet so they don't know as much about avoiding pitfalls. Women in their 30's often carry around the mistakes of their past. This could include emotional baggage, exes that they share kids with, a general sense of jadedness and less optimism as they've watched their youth fade and dreams slowly get murdered by life choices and circumstances out of their control. On the positive side, women in their 20's are bright, energetic, curious, optimistic, open-minded, and fun. Women in their 30's are smarter, wiser, have more responsible priorities, have accomplished more things and found more of a real sense of self and are still young enough to have fun but old enough to moderate fun and make better decisions.

Thats more than nothing. It's hard to not be able to do as many things every day as a mentally healthy person can. I relate so much to this. Because of bipolar, I cant commit to a program a lot of the time. Because my moods arent stable or reliable (even with treatment), I dont like to commit to things like PPL or StrongLifts because it brings shame and disappointment to my already bad days/weeks.

      "One of the things Abraham has said is that those who have made their transition are now in a state of joy, love and well-being, and in order for us to tune into them easily, we need to be around that frequency. So reach out (they can sense it when you think of them) and tune in when you feel your joyful highs. You can also become aware of them when you're not as high, but it takes sensitivity and self-awareness. When someone from non-physical communicates with you, you will experience it in the field of your own thoughts and feelings. So if they send you a mental message, a thought will pop into your head alongside your other thoughts. If they send love, you will feel it alongside your other feelings. Because of this, if you don't have a clear sense of what your own thoughts and feelings are like, you could be receiving messages from them but not realizing it. It can also be very easy to doubt that what you're receiving is coming from them. They can also communicate in other ways, such as: Triggering a memory Bringing your attention to something (for example, drawing your gaze to a certain book) Arranging synchronistic events Influencing animals When you're closer to their high vibrational frequency (feeling joyful), it will be easier for you to hear them and have a sense of knowing about it. Meditation can make it easier to recognize their inner messages to you by: Increasing your sensitivity Giving you a clearer sense of your own thoughts/feelings Silencing your mind Quieting your emotions Raising your vibration If you want to connect with a high-level guide and channel it like Esther does, that's something you can learn as well. If you want to learn more about that, a great book on the subject is Opening to Channel, by Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer (note: this is about channeling a high-level guide, not communicating with loved ones on the other side).

      "I started experiencing catatonia and some negative symptoms at went to see a psychiatrist, who didn't think much of it for whatever reason until I started hallucinating during catatonic stupors. At this point he gave me an antipsychotic called Latuda, which I was hesitant to begin taking because I knew how nasty antipsychotics can be. Eventually I decided to just give it a shot and took one at breakfast. Not even an hour later I was in an intense dysphoria and feeling suicidal for the first time. I tried to sleep through it and eventually did. I refused to take any more and gave the psychiatrist the sample packs I hadn't opened back and told him I wasn't interested in trying any other brands of medication at which point he basically told me to come back if I ever wanted to try a different medication strongly implying he wasn't willing to try anything else. After I stopped seeing him I had a couple of delusions, the most prominent of which was that a group of supernatural beings called the watchers were trying to make me commit suicide and were responsible for making my psychiatrist give me the Latuda and were later trying to sneak the medicine into my food, so I froze everything before eating it because I believed that it would break down at temperatures below freezing. I never really acted on the delusions around other people and so it didn't even affect my ability to do my job very much. At that time I fortunately wasn't working around other people very often and so any catatonia went unnoticed. Recently I haven't been experiencing any symptoms of schizophrenia because I've had very nearly no stress.

People are generally pretty understanding of the concept of boning each other's brains out and not falling in love, even if it isn't something everyone personally is equipped to do. On the other hand, the idea of a deep, loving, committed, long-term emotional relationship with one person, while each of you filling your sexual needs **outside** that relationship, is much more nebulous, difficult, and even offensive to most people. The legacy that religiously enforced monogamy has left on our culture is a difficult one to unpack. Sex without love was a pretty easy one to figure out, because let's face it... we always had that one licked. Love without sex, particularly love without sex with a partner who is having sex with other people, is a much trickier concept for the average person to wrap their head around.\n",

Plus then you need night time pads, and liners for a couple of days after. Its also 13 periods per year (28 day cycle, not 31), and many people last more than 5 days. And 38 years is optimistic 45 to 50 is probably more realistic. Looking at the Coles website, 20c each also seems more realistic. So, lets redo your maths: 16 hours of tampons every 4 hours 4 tampons. So tampons only is 20 per period (on average), times 13 is 260/year, which is $52. But we have to buy 6 night time pads- theyre 30c each, so 6 x 13 $24. And now if we need 4 pads per day as well, theyre about 20c each as well, so thats another $52. Plus a couple of boxes of liners per year is another $10. So annually call it $140/yr, over 50 years. Were now talking close enough to $7000. So were actually talking $700 tax. Ouch.

      " There is a rating on videogames for a reason. There isn't though. Game Publishers pay ESRB to rate their games. PEGI and CERO are also independent companies that rate games. Some games have all three ratings, others don't have a single one. There's no legal requirement to have an ESRB rating. Some games are too violent for kids. Opinion really. I enjoyed M rated games as a kid, I grew up fine. I know plenty others who did as well. Its the same reason that kids cant go to see an R rated movie without a parent. They can, actually. It's entirely legal. Sure, theaters have restrictions, but that's their own policy. Movies don't require ratings either. During that time, a lot of people were worried videogames might be influencing their children negatively. Despite an overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary. This is something that actually makes her look good if you think about it. Censorship and enforced gatekeeping to creative industries does not make anyone look good. You just needed your parent to come with you so that the clerk knew it was okay to sell the game. Except you legally don't. Plenty of games don't have ratings, anyway. What do you want to do about those? Games that *would* get AO or M ratings could easily just *not* get rated and sell their game to minors *anyway*. Or go with a more relaxed rating company.\n",

      "It's great to see posts like these! Very thorough and helpful. I'll add a bit: In fact, I remember reading somewhere that if you wanted to get some more clarity in regards to your type, you should refer back to what you were like as a child. Right. In childhood, one really only operates on their dominant function. It is the only one that is developing. Everything else is essentially meaningless up until about age 13 I'd say, when you start developing your others. Also, mental illness doesn't often strike that young so you don't have this influencing whatever conclusions you've drawn. Not to mention that taking the MBTI whilst struggling with a mental illness will sometimes lead to unclear results. There are two remedies to this: 1. take the test once you're more level-headed, and 2: only use the test as a very coarse rubric, and investigate other types that you could be (using function theory). Either way, don't rely on test results. Don't rely too heavily on your party persona for an accurate typing. But do be aware that any extroversion you demonstrate will be manifestations of your extroverted functions Ne and Te. Ne is witty, bouncy and a great party piece. Te is pragmatic, judgment-oriented, and good at seeing through ideas in real-life. That's dominant Fi for you. Either way, if you think you're Fe, then you're neither ENFP nor INFP, since both types are introverted feeling-dominant. People with Fe often use language such as x makes me uncomfortable, i get bad feelings about that, are you okay?... but know this is a very vague rubric and is up to interpretation. Generally Fe users always pry (which we hate, and which is why my mother knows virtually nothing about me) and want to make sure everything is just fine with everybody involved. You'll see what I mean in the real world. Fi, on the other hand, is very reserved as to what messages are conveyed. People with Fi at whatever function order most often use vague language that doesn't give mention to any of their *internal states*. The ENFP is one of the best social creatures because of this. Their pounding Ne just keeps wit and humor going (and frankly they are geniuses for it), to the extent that everyone loves you, and you have way too many friends. But at the end of the day people still consider you somewhat of an enigma (unless of course you tilt that Fi outwards a bit)\n",

I think the deist conception of God, a being who created the universe but has not interfered since, has a rightful claim to the term God. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. If God were to guarantee each human an eternal and blissful afterlife, then he cannot be called malevolent; no finite span of time amounts to anything compared to eternity. Why he would want to subject humans to earthly life in the first place is irrelevant; he would still be a deity, and a rather benevolent one at that. Is he both able, and willing? Then whence cometh evil? If willing X means will always perform X if the means are available, then yes, there can't be a perfectly omnipotent being who desires that there be no evil. Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? If there were a being that created the universe, didn't have power to interfere in the physical universe after that, didn't really want to stop evil because he thought it was funny in a cosmic sort of way, but could still whisk our souls away to an eternally blissful afterlife upon death, then I don't see why this being couldn't be called God. tl;dr the argument only refutes a very narrow concept of God.

      "so this one time i really wanted swiss miss hot chocolate, but we didn't have any and the supermarket is like 3 miles from where i live, which meant i wasn't going to walk. *luckily*, there's a local pharmacy really close to us, so i walked to it to see if they had any swiss miss there. they didn't. and a real pharmacist who went to college to study medicine probably had an existential crisis as he spent a full 5 minutes checking the back room of an empty store (besides me) for fucking hot chocolate. i bought a bag of reeses pieces on my way out because i didn't want to leave without buying anything. feeling quite dejected, i made my way home. by that point, without my swiss miss, i had nothing better to do than watch that twin brother show on HGTV (and switch to Chopped on commercial breaks), eat 80g sugar worth of reeses pieces, and bitch to all my friends about not having any warm beverages to numb the pain. (this is where the REAL plot twist happens!!!) one of those friends also happened to be my brother, and on his way home, he decided to stop and get me some hot chocolate! !!! only problem was, he bought a combo pack of dark chocolate, and my favorite flavor, milk chocolate with marshmallows. but, i was in no position to complain about the variety of swiss miss i'd been provided with, so for a few weeks, i casually drank all the marshmallow packs while tastefully avoiding the dark chocolate packs. THAT IS, UNTIL TODAY BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, you have not experienced life until you try the deep, rich flavor that is dark chocolate swiss miss hot chocolate. i want to end up in a position in life where drinking dark chocolate swiss miss hot chocolate is an everyday, normal thing, and where i can make this absolute BLISS a part of my everyday routine. just looking at the box makes me horny ffs. i highly recommend 10/10 best middle-class-luxury hot chocolate on the market it will NOT disappoint 5 stars would recommend to a friend\n",

      "/u/jellybellybean2 *you never said your kid is ADHD and I honestly do not care if your kid is ADHD or not.* I am personally an INTJ person with ADHD, and my advice applies to all kids and teens regradless of whether they have ADHD or not. I think this info I am about to link to in a video will be useful to you and that is why I am sharing it. But I recommend parents of late elementary school and middle school and high school watch this video I am about to link. The video is part of a playlist but the part I linked to is in the middle of the playlist where it talks about something called Executive Functions and what do you DO IN THE ENVIRONMENT, to help people with executive function difficulties (regardless of the cause, one cause of many for EF difficulties is ADHD, but there are many causes of EF difficulties) So watch the part of the video I linked, it is Section 6 out of 10, but since some sections have multiple videos it will be video 12 in the playlist. I also recommend watching Sections 7 and Sections 8 (Videos 13 to 18) even if your kid is not ADHD. All of those stuff are things all parents struggle with and all kids struggle with. One of the reasons is certain executive functions are maturing at the age of 10 to 12, but other executive functions are now starting to appear once you have those foundational EFs built, you are now using the executive function system in a more complicated and more creative way.\n",

      "This( is some of the last artwork I did. As I said, I haven't done any real artwork in years. Since I started doing daki artworks and really analyzing what makes some of my favorites look good I've picked up a number of techniques, so my more recent artworks are probably better despite years of not doing it. All I've really done lately besides daki artwork is original character blueprints and chibis, and I don't like sharing my OC artwork since it's all for a light novel series I'm writing. Edit: I dunno how well those images show it, but when it comes to shading and lighting I have somewhat of a sharp, high contrast style like in the linked BBA art above. I do it a little softer than that, but my mind just doesn't interpret visuals in such a way that I'll ever be capable of producing super soft, smooth images (like Carnelian). Also, I tend to put a lot of priority on eyes, and in my personal style I try to put a lot of detail into eyelashes for female characters or androgynous male characters. I feel that eyes can convey a lot about the character even in a single image. The way I approach hair highlights hasn't changed much in concept, but I'm working on better ways to do it so it looks nicer. Edit+: I just finished R-18 Haruka side 1.

Buddhas are definitely worshiped, and this is core to buddhism, since the centrality of your relation to the buddha himself was placed as as high a level as the eternal truths of the teachings as one of the three jewels. Worship was standard fare in the understanding of people in this time period. It was continuous with any other show of respect, and buddhas as supremely exalted beings were placed at the top without even denying local mid tier gods. The connotations are different than christianity, but so what? So is every polytheistic religion. Trying to de-deify buddhas is a western construct that makes no sense in any context other than taking christianity as a standard for all theism. But you never see people sitting around insisting that greek polytheism isn't theism for this reason. They do not believe in a creator god(s). This is how you know that someone is saying something misleading about buddhism. Most religions in most places most of their gods were not creator gods. The idea that a god has to be a creator god to be important is another attempt to read christianity into a religion from a different culture. Hell, in some forms of hinduism the creator god was considered pointless to worship, since all he does is create. Its the ones relevant to current existence that matter. Buddhism is continuous with these eastern religions for a reason. It having apotheosis in it doesn't make it nontheistic according to any coherent metric. Its more transtheistic, or its been called transpolytheistic.\n",

      "Hello :) Per our rules DAE style posts have to explicitly relate to MBTI, rather than just asking INFJs. This helps to ensure that posters are making an effort to link the behavior to a theoretical reason why INFJs (or any other type) would behave a certain way because of their personality. If you are asking about a specific behavior, we ask posters to but in a little more leg work. If you're not sure about functions or any other parts of personality theory, you can just ask that :) For what it's worth, I think you're talking about anthropomorphism, which from a google search seems to be commonly associated with INFPs, though I haven't found any justification for why in terms of functions. I would guess it has to do with Fi and projecting one's own feelings onto others? In other words, I would feel lonely if I were that cookie, I shouldn't let it be lonely. Now, using Fi doesn't mean you're not an INFJ everyone can use all the functions, but if you do it for everything maybe it's something to consider. Anyway, thanks for posting and I hope you post again in the future :)\n",

      "Well caring people like you and me will probably pick them up and help them. Given there were no welfare, new organizations would pop up and help those people. Traditionally, churches and charity organizations existed with the goal to help people. They will continue to do that. Now, with people being freed from having that much taken off their paychecks by default, they have more money on their hands to donate to those organizations. Yes, some will say fuck you, I got mine why can't you get yours? but I am convinced that most people are not cold hearted and will donate to causes they care about. A story I'd like to tell is that I had a cataract in both eyes when I was four years old. I needed surgery within two weeks or I would have gotten blind. Fortunately, my family was off well enough to afford surgery so I could see. Unfortunenately many people aren't able to afford such surgery, especially in places like Africa. Since I had surgery, my family is donating a fix amount of money to children in Africa every year, so that they can get surgery and see. The reason why I am telling this story is to emphasize on something that hasn't been said yet. Many people are able to be empathetic if they had similar experiences. As in my example, it lead my family to donate to charity for this very issue. People will care and people will donate. If we can donate enough money to send a lance to moon we can donate and help to keep our children fed.\n",

Air Supremacy gives IJN strike a larger advantage than USN strike, with 2-to-1 fighter addition; that's 10v7, up from 8v6. While a 212 Essex would turn it around to 14v10, at least the fighter groups are equal; it's the split squadrons of IJN that give them the actual edge. Barring actually giving 212, I've had this idea to improve USN without changing loadouts, and that would be giving them a 'Saipan-mode' that can be activated when chosen to, which then splits fighter and TB squadrons in half. It gives USN some IJN capability, with their superior individual planes but less in number. It also raises the skill ceiling of USN CVs potentially enough to bring balance back between IJN and USN.\n",

      "Much obliged! You're quite right about our positions, I think they're rather clear. But thanks for that. I hope the best for you. Though I'm not aiming to sway more so to inform of a very small subset of Christian theological frameworks available, which the branching is, as you said, a modern phenomenon to begin with. This will be a long post, but I get the feeling that doesn't bother you. The last century is very telling. We can allow history to give context and lessons but it would be unwise to give it precedence over logically coming to a conclusion from the text in front of us. If we assume time is linear, then each part (let's say Century, for this example's sake) is weighted the same, right? But when you factor in variables like population growth and the increasing dissemination of information globally, it's not difficult to see our forefathers and foremothers made the best decisions available with what information they could get. Which, up until the Reformation (printing press!) was difficult, since everybody (not literally) was illiterate. We shouldn't condemn unwillful ignorance, but as information, such as new manuscripts being discovered, appeared, it's only rational that new information leads to new conclusions (though, as I'll explain, they aren't new at all-just muddled and mixed in lots of the things history and war and the greed of humanity produces). Plus, we have the technology and the proper cultural hermeneutic to analyze the reasons why beliefs changed, or stayed the same, through time. On the topic of hermeneutics, or interpretations, if the lens being looked through is cloudy, of course the reader is helpless to pick and choose. That is the only tool he has, for the moment. Everyone has a lens, and I'm not special. We all need a way to interpret the world and our universe. Perhaps my lens could be clouded, yes. But for our purposes, let's say I'm taking in as much information as I can, to keep my lens as clean and clear as possible. The ends of all that information I take in is reconciliation. On one hand, I fully acknowledge that, as you mentioned, it seems at first glance God is a capricious, cruel master. Why did he flood the earth? Why was only the high priest allowed into the Holy of Holies once a year? There aren't any easy answers, although the text might give us hints (eg. God demonstrating his hate of sin, how hard it is to commune with him through normal means) that sets the tone and/or even foreshadows the ministry of Jesus. Though crucifixion, death by asphyxiation seems barbaric to us, on the other side, what would a first century Roman think of the SCOTUS' Hobby Lobby ruling? The standards have changed, but it's a little egocentric to assume the moral high ground. Modern society is not necessarily in a better place morally than the ancients. What I do see is the same God who tested Abra(ha)m and ordered destruction of the Canaanites, also revealed a very different, eternal perspective on the reasons and meanings of human existence. Who knows what happened to the people who died- probably driving flying cars and swimming in pools of jello in the heavenlies? That's not to excuse what happened to them on earth, but we can't miss that there's a possibility that there is more to existence then the 70 or so years we have with the help of modern medicine. On God's methodology for salvation. I don't know his original reasoning for plotting it out this way, but the end result for me (and others, I suppose) is peace. Sometimes the universe, like the beloved novels we love to read or epic video games we love to play, is absurdly comforting like that. Now, if you assume literal blood baths, yes that sounds pretty gross unless the person is a gladiator. But if it's interpreted metaphorically (context clues are important here) it means I am no longer bound to sin, though I sin, or to the Law, though it still exists. Another way of phrasing this is that a regular Joe like me can hang out with a holy God any time, where it was reserved for one guy once a year before. The model of good isn't Jesus' hankering for hemoglobin, but rather his selfless life. I still find Zombie Jesus drawings and references hilarious. Satan does indeed believe in God's existence, but he doesn't trust him. I can acknowledge my elderly neighbor is alive, but I don't choose to put my life in his hands. Here's the NT reference you asked for- Paul is referencing the Law being binding until Jesus's final breath: Or do you not know, brothersfor I am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress. Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code. (Romans 7:1-6 ESV) Therein lies the difference- Satan still wants to push people into guilt and shame when they screw up their lives or for not following the ten commandments, for example. Grace can free people into new identities and relationships not marked by behavior or good works done. Works are a natural fruit of faith, and faith is shown by works. But it's repeated again and again by the NT writers that faith in Christ's finished work is the only necessary condition to enter heaven (more pertinent, to have a relationship with God while we're still on earth). James has this to say on faith and works: But someone will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeand shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousnessand he was called a friend of God.' (James 2:18-23 ESV) Indeed, we do start in subservience from a Christian worldview. As far as who has the power in the relationship, it's no contest. But believing God makes us his friends. What you see as inherently flawed, I see as freedom to choose. What you see as destined to evil, I see as a rational choice- man chooses what he can see over what he cannot. And that's okay. Because, despite what those picketers on campuses and street corners and parades say, hell is not as easy to get into (or so categorically filled) as it seems. But I suppose that's another can of worms, one I am theologically liberal on. I think God's a lot more generous with heaven (and himself) then the gay haters think. I hope this answered some of your questions. I'm just a dude, but I'm a dude who realized, to my chagrin, that Christ is the only logical response to a screwed up world. If I wanted a religion that made sense, I would have stuck with Buddhism and followed the eightfold path. But I wanted exorbitant, outrageous life and I want redemption for the lonely and the hopeless, and so far Jesus has the most compelling story. Again, new information often leads to new conclusions. I'm open, but the alternatives are looking bleak.\n",

My struggle, as both someone who has always felt different and someone who is addicted to mbti, is the idea of being part of the most common type. It bothers me (and always has) to think that there are so many people out there like me, when I have always felt weird.

My other issue with the typing of ISFJ is the extreme bias against it in the mbti community. I am not a traditionalist, I am a deep thinker, I plan for and romanticize the future, etc etc etc. I have never empathized with other ISFJs and much as other INFJs.

I used to be very monogamous and would commit myself emotionally and completely to the people I was with, but this past year I moved past it and it felt as if I broke out of a shell that I didn't realize I was dwelling in. I think that as a women especially, it's a very difficult outlook to have because of so much pressure from media and society to commit to someone and settle down. There's also a lot of r/niceguys out there who feel as if you owe them your romantic monogamy because they treat you with a minimal amount of respect and decency.\n",

I'll focus briefly on one by analogy: Compare asking Hispanic people for papers with stopping and searching a Black man for possible criminal activity. If you have no reason to suspect that specific Black man other than because he is black, then your stop is likely a civil rights violation. Similarly, if you stop and ask a Hispanic person for immigration documentation just because they look Hispanic, then your stop is likely a civil rights violation. Now, stop-and-frisk may have been okay on it's own. But when shown to have a clear racial component, it becomes problematic( Where immigration enforcement has a clear racial component, it is also problematic. Further complicating the issue, you don't need papers to be out and about in America. I can leave my wallet and ID at home to take a stroll around my neighborhood or go to work and I'm not doing anything wrong. I don't have to prove I belong. Granted, there are certainly circumstances where I *do* need an ID (enrolling in school, going to court, etc.), and immigration enforcement in those situations is hotly debated and an entirely different kettle of fish.\n",

      "I just have the certification test to complete but I've been working in a EOC Nurse role under a more experienced colleague, and went through Emory University's WOC Nurse program so I think I could give you a decent idea of what to expect (this is long and all typed out on mobile, so beware..!). I discovered during nursing school getting my BSN that whenever I was changing a dressing I felt like I was at my most nurse-ly. Although I was unable to get a wound clinic clinical, I got onto a surgical floor where I'd be exposed to incisions and wounds and amputations and whatnot. This facility tried to allow new nurses to have shadow experiences with most of the specialities that would be pertinent to the care they would be providing, so as soon as I was paired up with one of the WOC nurses I made it very well known that I was interested in pursuing this career path and paid close attention. Any time any patient of mine had a wound care consult I tried to arrange my day to be there when the WOC nurse was so I could be familiar with their process, really get the details of their recommendations and how they came to that point, and once again, expressed to all of them that I was interested in pursuing this role in the future. It's expected you will get a few years of active acute care experience before you apply for education for a role like this, so I would request (from charge) the patients with the complex dressing changes and would regularly take on the ostomy patients to build up my confidence and competence. If I saw the WOC nurses and had a spare few moments, I'd offer to help them with their consult (which they loved---usually it's just one of them to work with whatever patient they are consulted for--morbidly obese, geriatric FTT who was too weak to turn self, etc). I tried to be the skin care rep for my floor, but the nurse who had it wouldn't give up the role despite not wanting to pursue that area in the future. Regardless, when a position opened up for the WOC Nurse team they thought of me and encouraged me to apply. My facility was holding out for someone who all ready had the education and experience, but nobody applied so they eventually opened it up to someone new and offered to pay for the training (having a facility pay for the training is likely something you won't experience--the person in charge of managing that had no idea how extensive the training was, but they had to keep to their word AND the current WOC Nurses working for them tried to tell them multiple times that this isn't like most certifications in how much you have to do). I applied, interviewed, and got the job! I enrolled in Emory University's program, based out of Atlanta, Georgia, considered the gold standard for WOC Nurse education and training. I signed up for the online training (there is on-site learning available if you're in the area), which involved having proof of current licensure and experience in MedSurg, and having a list of local WOC nurses who were willing to precept me in the future (this is also where it helped having experienced colleagues--they had a great network to utilize to help make this process easier). When I got accepted I bought the recommended text books and then bought my first module. It was around $1500 at the time for the one, but the prices vary and it may be more now. This allowed me a three month period to watch the online lectures (accompanied by this great notebook sent to you by Emory), and complete the assignments and tests. Each module cost the same, and regardless of how many certifications you wanted to go for (explained in next paragraph), you have a Professional Practice Module to complete at the end of the program to help clarify your scope, role, and to provide more tools for you to use in providing education to patients and staff.\n",

      "Perhaps it goes without saying, but perhaps it doesn't: however much you care about your partner, you should never feel compelled to express those feelings in a way that makes you uncomfortable. If the words don't seem appropriate, then fine: that's a good thing to talk about. What it's not, is something you force yourself to say simply cos you think it's expected of you. Easy enough for me to say it all, I know. Honestly, I think some of it comes down to maturity. And I don't mean that in a Bah, you're just a kid sort of way. I mean it in a Your expectations of other people are unreasonable sort of way. People express their emotions in the way that's most comfortable for them. Some people say the 'L' word to everyone they know. Christ, when I was a teenager, I said it to every girl who gave me a smile. But back then I don't think I entirely understood what it meant, and I also don't think I knew what I expected to hear in reply. Sometimes the words you're able to express simply don't measure up to the depth of feeling in your heart. If your partner understands you enough, then that doesn't matter. Because they can see a little way into your heart through the way you treat them, and they already know how you feel. If my partner said she loved me, then I'd be shocked surprised. But not because she suddenly started loving me; because she'd suddenly changed her entire vocabulary of affection. *(I'm not pretending that wouldn't be great though. She murmured it the other night while talking in her sleep, which was fun. The fact that minutes later she called me a big Cunt Butterfly makes me take it with a pinch of salt.

Lots of people probably match this shape perfectly, but it's a large range, which sort of defeats the purpose of typology in general. EDIT- I see. This visualizer is running purely off of signed Cognitive functions, simply relabeled to be easier to read by the common viewer: Ti- -- 'Accurate', Te- -- 'Effective', Si+ -- 'Historical'. However, I must remind you that Ne+ usage != optimism. Ti+ != focus. They are associated, correlated maybe, but certainly not mutually implicative.\n",

      "I have to say, I think you're half right, half wrong. Honestly, 'the body' does control your emotions, you're just putting the mind on some sort of pedestal because let's face it-it's romantic to do. You'd hate for the body to be in control of the mind, but that's only because you can't see that accepting and understand reality don't make the world any less of a beautiful or intuitive place, they just change to a slightly different way. But this doesn't address the main point I'm trying to make. Problem is, younger/less mature feelers agree with you, and therefore are left with nowhere to go. When they get triggered, they believe nothing will help them, and so, *nothing will*. They crave to stay in that romantic mindset, and so they do. Let's face it, NFJs are fantastic at lying to themselves, (at least ENFJs are), and they don't realize that by forcing themselves to believe the lie, it does, in a way become true. A lot of NFs have situations that escalate out of control that easily could be stopped by following these simple steps. That does **not** negate that if they have faced that trauma that they should be receiving the right form of treatment for it. You're right. But you and palaner are talking about apples and oranges... he in no way seeks to treat your long scarred past with breathing techniques, while you certainly don't need to use heavy psychoanalysis on brief situations where an NF is most likely just 'riding the wave' of intoxicating emotion.

      "The following is assuming you're not being sarcastic (I mean no offense if you aren't) Quirks/aspects of capitalism create bad situations for people, but it does do a lot of good for the world. There's a reason the US has the highest GDP (beating out the combined EU) despite not being the biggest country by almost all other metrics. While they do have many issues, they create a lot for the rest of the world and provide for much of the world economy. Communism, especially on a large-scale, is a *fatally* flawed system that will NOT work in the real world. Even if it were to somehow skirt across-the-board bureaucratic corruption and somehow install a benevolent administration (good luck), it would contrive the system under which people live, to some extent; in such a communist utopia/dystopia the populous would find themselves with little reason to pursue innovations that would end up bettering our world. One could argue that socialist policies are quite beneficial to a country in many ways, and I'd often be inclined to agree. But to say that we would all be better under some whimsical worldwide provide-for-all government is, and I say this as a progressive liberal, positively insane.

Then in the comments you go on.. and hes told me that he has done things with a man before multiple times he said he might be bi. Might be. Watches ManonMan, Has Engaged with ManonMan, tried to engage ManonMan while with you.... I think the 'might' is a bit redundant. He likes men. He might also like women too, he might not. Not enough detail to try and gather that. Your watching his porn consumption in the hopes it suddenly lines up with the words he's telling you, insisting on how he feels and there is nothing else to say. It's like gaslighting. It might not be malicious meaning to hurt you, but the effect is the same regardless, you are doubting your sanity because he keeps insisting it's not something he's bothered about.. Personally OP I think you would be better out of this relationship. When it gets to the point where one partner is obsessing over these sorts of details (Your keeping track of porn, that's not healthy, and it's likely his fault, but still not good) the damage is pretty deep. They'll be other things no doubt.. little things setting your spider sense off that you can never quite place your finger on. You have to stop taking him at his denial word, because the only thing his words are reflecting is what he wants you to think.

I did the calculations a while back. You lose 2 melee minions from the lane, taking that into account, the krugs are worth +35 gold and +40 exp so as a result you hit level 2 one minion earlier and maintain even gold because the support generally needs to use a potion, so it effectively gives that gold to the ADC.\n",

      "I used to hate getting the advice to be confident or just be yourself, because I thought those things were contradictory. I'm not confident by nature, and if I was to be confident in approaching a girl, I'd feel disingenuous. That's not the case, though. I think there are many sides to who you are as a person. On some days, I can be extremely lazy and not want to do anything, even so far as to cook simpler meals so that I don't have to spend as much time cooking. On other days, I feel ready to start some projects and go out and skateboard. My point is, you aren't limited to being one type of person all the time. No one is like that, and I think in the process of trying to be true to yourself, you'll realize that as well. So back to confidence- I'd be lying if I said that I can confidently talk to women with no anxieties at all now, but I have definitely gotten better at it. And a part of that is believing in yourself as being worth something. Loving yourself. Hell, even liking yourself is a good start. I didn't have much confidence at all in high school because I didn't like myself as a person. I hated how I looked, hated how lazy and unmotivated I was, and I kept telling myself that if I were better looking, stronger, richer, faster, smarter... basically anything other than myself, I'd be happy. The trick to feeling confident is being comfortable in your own skin. Understand that there are things you can change and things you just can't, and you'll either learn to be okay with it, or you're going to spend the rest of your life knocking yourself down every time you get up.\n",

But we're not going to see any real effort on his part to protect that particular right. He's basically the most establishment Democrat she could have picked. In a normal election year he would be an extremely safe VP pick, but this is not a normal election year. It hints at Hillary treating her presidency exactly how she would have in a normal political climate, where politicians promise the moon when they're a candidate and then conveniently forget their promises once they're in office.

      "Personally, the best way for me to make these decisions is to compartmentalize the situation into Emotion VS Logic. I think about the emotion I am feeling that is caused by the situation and I process that separately from the course of action I should take. I *try* to do this because everyone has their coping mechanisms, and not everyone is completely aware of the coping mechanisms that they express under stress. There is the whole flight, fight, or freeze and then there can be specific, learned responses due to trauma or childhood. So, I compartmentalize the *Why am I feeling this?* question and I start to dissect my initial response to the situation **before** expressing it. Learning to be self-aware takes development, and can never *truly* be mastered. It took time and lots of *failing*, but I have become better at processing my emotions and feelings before making a decision *based* on them. Working through this helps paint a clear picture of what to do next and then I can completely focus my thoughts on the *logic* aspect (e.g. finding the resolution/answer to move forward) For me atleast, the more and more I do this the better I become at understanding my coping mechanisms and it becomes much easier for me to identify the triggers and why I initially react certain ways to certain situations or feelings.\n",

      "It really does depend on what you're defining as the constraints of your question. And such is not very specific. If we're talking about just using motion as a supplementary control then we'd want to look at things like TrackIR, Razor Hydra, the recent iMotion, PrioVR and similar technologies. Arguably even 3d mice may fit the bill. They're sort of niche technologies though and don't have a very large market at the moment. Personally I think the Razor Hydra is the most promising as a control system. It seems to work very well, it's not cumbersome or super expensive and it's an interface that people are familiar with through using gamepads. I can see just anyone being able to just put it to use. Full body suits may become more popular someday, but not until we have a way to solve the fact that people would want to walk around in them. The omni treadmill is promising, but it takes up a lot of space and I'm not personally convinced that people want to stand up and run around while enjoying videogames. A kinect-like system wouldn't work either because people would walk off-screen or need a contraption that would inevitably block them from clear view. I bring up mostly virtual reality because this is where this question has been the most active recently. If you're just talking about mapping motion to certain actions rather than something more ambitious I think your best bet is literally kinect. Hobbyist hackers have been able to very neat things with it that show that it's possible to get a lot out of the hardware if you try hard to and can control the environment that the camera is placed in. There's military and police technologies as well. A particular one I read about a while ago was a police application that analyzed security footage to track individuals across multiple cameras as long as the camera views intersected, as well as a military turret that could automatically target humanoids. It's not a very established field yet. The functioning technologies are ones like razor hydra that sort of lean a little bit on older tech while the newer technologies work about half of the time unless you want to put in months fine-tuning it to specific environments. This is a completely amateur impression of the state of the market. I don't think I missed anything too large or said anything particularly wrong since this is an area of interest for me, but I want to make it clear that I am not a professional in this field.\n",

      "Actually... could a blue deficiency and a red deficiency end up testing as a deutan deficiency? The reason i ask is that the medication I take that is known for causing blue-yellow color vison problems is a very high dose of estrogen (for reference I am transgender and take high levels of hormones. I have a feeling that throws vison off a little). I still cant ignore the blue/grey (especially azures and many violets as grey) confusion as well as the dark yellow/purple problems. I also have issues distinguishing not only bluish green and orange but also bluish green and yellowish green. I still have no idea why i fail deutan stuff so much. Unless a shift in deutan as well throws things off and makes me test as a deutanopia/strong deutan. I do know though that when i had the cx 14s when i wore them i would test as medium to strong protan (the 25s just have a much much less effect). Though i also have noticed protans talk about with that red vison/green vison image that if they sit back farther away then in their distance vison they can see that a lot more clearly. I do note that my vison is stuck at distance vison and stuff up close is blurry so i have my monitors at a farther distance away if that changes anything. When i get closer to it the red is weaker but the blurriness from being out of focus lets me see numbers in plates and such that if i put on my reading glasses disappear. A lot of factors here though that are just abnormal. I have xy chromosomes but my sex hormone levels are completely different and i have accomodation problems that others dont have. Im just unsure why i test deutan when so many of my problems are more on protan side and how my confusion colors line up with that. This image From what i understand deutan dont have issues with dimmed colors. I have mentioned before that I dont see bright colors and many things, especially red things are dull enough to miss or I guess after testing with a color app black and i seem to even on a computer have dimmed red. I just assumed others saw things that dark and that red is natually darker than other colors. I noticed deutans seem to call cyans blue and i have issues calling blue cyans grey and green cyans orange. I also have issues with more redder violets and some purples as grey. In fact a lot of red violets that arent brown are greys. Magenta is a blue-grey for me and ive described purple things as greyish/greenish blue. Blue purple/indigo are all just blue to me and even dark blue. I have issues seeing certain pinks as blue, especially with enchromas. Though red meat is difficult for me as it is grey which makes it difficult to tell if it is spoiled or not(pink/light red being grey is more deutan right?). Do deutans associate brown as being a green? To me brown is not a very reddish color and i have a hard time finding actual brown because i always end up searching dark green for brown (is dark green and brown the same for you too?). I mix up oranges and greens a lot (id probably lose a carrot if i dropped it on a lawn. and for the life of me I have never figured out bananas (they trip everyone up but the difference for me is that unripe bananas are green and ripe ones are more of a whiter green). I dunno if these are deutan things. It also takes me extra time to notice break lights so I drive slower and leave a lot more distance. I also slow down near stop lights as honestly in the day it is a little more difficult to see the red light while the white/green one is always bright. I used to have a problem with older game boys and gbas in that when the light changed to red it was harder to see. LEDs are fine and luckily a lot of stop lights are leds and now a lot of brake lights are too. Older brake lights are just a pain for me to deal with. I also had this alarm clock when i was younger that in the day I couldn't see anything but at night it is okay. I have an easier time seeing red lights at night in general. Tv remotes were the very worst. My mom had this one that I was never able to tell if it was out of batteries or working normally. Do deutans have this problem? this image is really correct for me( Especially the bluish-green red and red orange green as well as yellow-green and orange. Plus cyan blue and magenta? Yes. Purple and blue indeed but indigo is grey unless it is darker in which case it is blue. I already showed you light orange and bluish green as well. Here is deutanope btw( granted that is more towards stronger/deuteranopia.\n",

If he actually regularly asked for the ball when there is a more efficient shot for a corner three/layup/etc. then that would not be the case. Now assuming that's true, then you could make the argument that perhaps his on/off numbers would be better if he tried to find the more efficient shot anyway. That is debatable, but there actually wasn't a whole lot of spacing on Kobe's teams post-Shaq like we regularly see on really good small-ball lineups today.\n",

      "Alright, the lack of knowledge here is really frustrating me. Now for clarification I am both someone who enjoys choking his girlfriend and has been participating in Martial Arts for years. I am very familiar with various forms of choking and the damage they can inflict. I would also like to state that I have choked a training partner unconscious before, and never my gf. So you could say I know what I'm doing. So lets talk about the damages. There are two ways you can cause permanent/severe damage, the first is crushing/damaging the windpipe. This is easy to avoid. Put most of the pressure on the side of the neck. If he's doing the normal sex choke that should be a problem. Never put a forearm on the throat or something like that. The second possibility is brain damage due to a lack of oxygen. Now there are videos online of people being choked to death. I have seen one or two of them and it takes a VERY, VERY long time. First they go limp, then it takes maybe another 2 minutes or so. A perfect rear naked choke, the classical martial arts sleaper hold from behind is faster, but you can't replicate that just with the hands on throat method. Unless he chokes you unconscious and continues choking you for another minute or so, you'll be fine. Being unconscious on it's own won't hurt you. And being chocked unconscious is SO difficult to begin with. Your partner needs to be really strong to do it, or start putting you in sleeper holds. (This I only recommend doing with someone who has martial arts and specifically submission grappling arts experience.) So do it with someone you trust not to pay absolutely no attention to you. Your partner does need to pay attention. But this is not as dangerous as people say. Just don't be choked without air for long periods of time. Make sure your partner knows to lay off for a few seconds every now and then. In summary. Get choked. It won't hurt you. Don't be completely stupid with it. And enjoy yourself.\n",

      "By definition, many picky eaters do in fact have an eating disorder called Restrictive Food Intake( disorder. Perhaps you don't quite understand where they are coming from because you don't suffer from the same kind of anxiety surrounding food. So let me shift perspective. Is there anything that you're irrationally afraid of? Needles? Spiders? Heights? Pickles or balloons, even? (Yes, those are real fears some people have.) If not, you certainly know at least one person with a phobia. Now, there are therapies and methods available to help treat phobias, called exposure and response prevention therapy (i.e. enduring ... something until they learn to like it). It can be very effective. But it is extremely difficult to do on your own, and it's not always successful the first time around. It has nothing to do with growing as human beings it's just very hard for anyone of any age to retrain the brain when it has fixated on a particular fear. Now let's switch back to selective eating. It's caused by extreme anxiety surrounding new foods. Even if the food won't hurt you any more than standing on a tall building, it can be very scary and daunting to try to consume it. It's not rational. Nobody is saying that it is rational. But that's why it's a disorder. It abnormally and negatively affects someone's life. And just because cultural factors affect what these people are afraid of (since there actually is a choice in food, there is a potential to develop food anxiety without the risk of starving) it doesn't make their condition any less real. Even though nobody had airplane phobias before airplanes existed, it doesn't make that fear any less real or debilitating for the sufferer. I urge everyone to try and be empathetic to the experiences of others. As I said before, it's extremely easy to dismiss what you don't understand because you cannot imagine what another person is feeling. But this isn't a battle of wills or a moral failure it's just another quirk of the human brain that interferes with some people's lives. And in the end it's nobody's business but theirs whether they want to treat their anxiety. Judgement and shame from the outside will not help in any way, and will possibly make food anxiety worse.\n",

      "I'm Chinese and you hit the nail on the head. Family always comes first. The practice of thinking of how things affect you gets stamped out of you at an early age. Growing up, I was expected to help out at my dad's business (mom quit her job to help out too), all the time with no pay. If I complained about it, my parents would be furious. I've watched my parents work overtime so they could have more money to send back home to their parents/siblings. The idea is that if someone in your family is struggling, everyone else works harder to help them out. That's the way things are in Chinese culture. OP, when she became your fiancee, you became part of her family. That means their struggles are now *your* struggles and you will be expected to shoulder the burden too. Anything less than that will be viewed very negatively. I can understand why your fiancee was so outraged, even if you brought up legitimate concerns. It goes against her whole concept of family. What I would do is sit down with her and tell her how much you love her and want to support her, but that she also has to try and accept your advice if she needs your help. I mean, if someone is throwing money down a hole, you're not going to keep handing them dollar bills, are you? This includes implementing the shift schedule and trying to hire more employees. It would help if you could show her how unsustainable the cafe is as it exists now (like have the expenses out in front of you on paper) and then show her how your changes could eliminate the need for her to constantly ask her friends and family for help (I'm sure she doesn't enjoy doing this). I know she might not react well to this, but what about the option of her selling the place? Isn't that what her parents intended to do in the first place? If this place isn't doing well enough to have real employees, then maybe this is the best option. If she isn't open to any of your suggestions at all and still demands you work for free, you have to decide whether this is something you want to sign up for. It seems as if there are strings attached to this marriage, and only you can decide whether it's worth it.\n",

Antibiotics are necessary for a lot of situations besides h pylori and save countless lives every year. There's no good reason to think you're going to be messed up for years from taking antibiotics. If you can handle lactose, some good yogurt is a good place to start. The relief! This is brilliant. It makes sense.

More episodes have had their own sort of 'suites' scoring the episode, with less 'character themes' and more 'mood themes' being iterated on throughout an episode. World Enough and Time was sort of this concept perfected, and the entirety of Season 10 is a good example of it at large. Even something like This Is Gallifrey was toned down and turned into something subtler, that you might actually miss it when it pops up in Extremis and The Lie of the Land et al., but gives the soundtrack a very New Doctor Who, Standard Form feel by tying it into his 12 year history of scoring for the show. And when I say WEAT is the concept perfected, that episode's soundtrack has All The Strange Strange Creatures pop up several times throughout, but I know I definitely did *not* notice it when I watched the episode, but definitely picked up on the sense that every minute of the score for the ep was just bang on. I actually think he should go, but because I believe he must be planning on leaving, and these stellar output has been his swan song.

      "Watch this video. I am personally agnostic atheist on whether there is a god. That said I believe there are sacred things out there (I am not going to explain my whole belief system) and this video is a good illustration that there are sacred things out there and to remind you during moments of loss. In this video we have two stories going on. There is a Se Ni story. Jethro (an ENFJ) is telling Moses (ISFP) that you can't know your purpose without knowing the entire story. The middle, the beginning, and the end. For there must be a twice blessed metaphor where to understand you must first lose the world only to regain it. Aka you must lose all that you can touch, in order to understand and truely see. Se=Ni=Se again, or you can also say Ni=Se=Ni again. But in that video there is also Si Ne story. Aka you have a history (Si), but in order to truely be, you must explore (Ne), and while the lyrics are not telling the Si Ne story in that video the visual pictures are telling the story. Moses must lose his home and loses his old bonds of brotherhood in order to explore and form new bonds of brotherhood including getting married to Jethro's daughter Zipporah...I am not sure of her type maybe ESFP, maybe ENFP, I am doing this from memory. To truly understand, to truly have wisdom you must have an Archimedean point, and from that point of view you can have a godly view and see all. Think of the Archimedean point as Ni But since humans can't really ever reach that view of Totality, we must instead see things from the inside and learn by ***doing*** ala Se. But all people are not just their first four functions, we are all 8 functions, and Ne and Si are other ways to learn. Thus sometimes the best teachers for an INTJ are people like the ENFPs for they have Ne and Si as conscious functions and not shadow functions, while an INTJ has Ni and Se as conscious functions and Ne and Si as shadow functions. ---- Think about these proverbs and point of view. The nut seed doesn't reveal the tree it contains. All seed answer light, but the color is different. The plant reveals what is in the seed. The seed cannot sprout upwards without simultaneously sending roots into the ground. The seed includes all the possibilities of the tree.... The seed will develop these possibilities, however, only if it receives corresponding energies from the sky. Grain must return to the earth, die, and decompose for new growth to begin. To truely understand you can't see the seed nut as a static object, but see it throught time from beginning, middle, and to end. Sometimes we can do this with objects, and sometimes we must merely believe and find that story through knowledge and not experience for we can't see the stories of everything. And sometimes knowledge is just knowledge and sometimes it is wisdom. Knowledge is not necessarily wisdom. Knowledge is consciousness of reality. Reality is the sum of the laws that govern nature and of the causes from which they flow. By knowing one reaches belief. By doing one gains conviction. When you know, dare.\n",

      "The majority of the species in my world are insects or reptiles because they were most able to adapt to the godblood. Godblood is a substance that mutates animals that come in contact with it, and insects and reptiles react most positively to its mutations. Mutated humans are collectively known as giants. They suffer some pretty severe health conditions, but if they overcome the conditions they are much stronger and bigger than any normal human. Ogri are human-sized bipedal lizards that hunt in packs but are regularly hunted to prevent their numbers from growing too large. Godblood mutated dinosaurs roam the land too, but they're mostly docile, or at least know to leave humans alone. Then there's minotaurs. I'm keeping details about them scarce for now, but I will say that they aren't typical fantasy minotaurs.\n",

      "The bottle in the second picture was a very light pink when I got it, if I remember correctly. I didn't like it at first because it was very perfumey. It's still a bit perfumey but after giving it a good shot I do like it (enough to buy a second bottle before the first one runs out). If I had to put my finger on what I like about it, it's because it has a lingering watermelon/fruity aftertaste. The menthol took a long time to settle and the watermelon took a long time to develop, so eventually it won out as being good in my book. If I had to compare it to anything I'm familiar with, the watermelon aftertaste reminds me of the honeydew aftertaste in Vapor Chef's Honey Pearry. (Very addictive) I just dripped the new bottle right now to compare and I can say that the menthol needs to mellow out but it completely lacks the perfuminess that the first pink bottle had. The fruit flavors are not well developed yet. The two blends are different, though. The first was 50/50 0 shots, the second is 65/35 1 shot.\n",

I think sometimes we can seem very passive. I am scared when around new friends or strangers of making mistakes and looking foolish. Appearing foolish is one of my biggest fears. So I would always sit out and look on politely, wanting to get involved but too scared. And I realised while sitting there how... much like my mother I was (and I hate that fake doormat side to my mum). I realised that by sitting back and protecting myself from failure, I wasn't maintaining my coolness but maintaining my incompetence. So while it's hard, I'm trying to get involved, and fail, because only by doing that can I get better and I get WAY more respect that way. I have no idea if that answered your question... :P I don't think being considerate is a problem at all. I am proud of how considerate I am, and you should be too! It is part of who we are, and more people should be like us! Just make sure that you're not hurting yourself (emotionally, physically, mentally, financially) in the process! Sexually asking never hurts. Sometimes they just need to be told but if they only give because you get annoyed, then they are not the right one for you. There are many others out there who would happily give more and who have higher sex drives, so don't limit yourself!! I thought I could put up with it.... but it's so not worth it.\n",

But I'm also well read, and I have a degree in sociology, I'm fairly interested in fine arts, and know a thing or two about both wine and designer furniture. But I'm also a complete sucker for watching a game of football and screaming at the TV. I'm also married and a father of two little girls, which makes me knowledgeable in both Dora the explorer songs and SpongeBob episodes. Still I'm tagged *macho*, because of my size and *guy-ish* behaviour. I promise, I hear something like this almost weekly: *oh, I didn't think YOU were interested in going to MOMA and seeing performance art?* And this almost exclusively (95% of the time) comes from women. I swear if *I* said something similar, I'd get an earful. After x amount of years defending my so called feminine interests, it's almost tempting to say people don't actually want diverse people. It' s easier to pidgeonhole and categorize, it takes way less effort. Rant over. Edit: I can't spell.\n",

She had been PMing platonically with a guy redditor and thought he would be a good match for me. She kind of wanted to set us up, but didn't really know how and since I was still reeling from a recent breakup, she didn't want to push too hard. At some point, some guy was being mean to her indirectly in an /r/AskReddit thread and I stepped in and was trying to defend her. I posted a picture of myself to prove a point and he in turn was being mean to me. She saw the thread, PMed guy redditor she thought would be a good match for me, and asked him to maybe go over to the thread and say something nice and supportive (with ulterior motives a plenty). He went to the thread, saw my picture, thought I was kind of cute, made some sweet, non-creepy comments, and ended up reddit comment stalking me a bit.

If we two Ts argue and I fail to convince you of my opinion, then we simply part ways. If we're equals I may respect your acumen even if I disagree with your opinion. And indeed I have probably relished the debate because it allowed me to refine my own thoughts. I will likely want to argue with you again. But when you argue with an F and they react emotionally it immediately puts an end to the discussion. They have pulled a trump card because society in general (primarily Fs) thinks hurting someone's feelings is something terrible. They completely turn the tables and suddenly the T is the bad guy. Moreover that debate can have consequences because the F is incapable of simply shutting off their negative emotions. They have to get over it or forgive you which can take a long time. It's easier to change your find than change your feelings. n.b. I'm not talking about insulting people in arguments or being condescending, ala obvious INTJs. I'm talking about Fs reacting negatively to someone not respecting their opinion. The idea that one should respect everyone's opinion is a very F thing to believe.

Granted, there are some negative effects of pure capitalism and only then should the state step in to address those effects.

The three branches of government are the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. No where in there is the business branch. The state should be there to protect the environment due to bad business practices that allow for dumping into land/water and contamination of the air. The state should be there to prosecute white-collar thieves. When business and the state mix, either by the state intruding into markets in order to guide them or business lobbying Congress in order to guide it that problems result. Business failure is a NORMAL and NECESSARY function of the markets. Weak businesses must be allowed to fail. The end result is stronger businesses on average.

      "You're a great writer, a great storyteller and a very astute observer. However, I have never really bought in to Howard's shtick about honest radio. Howard's honesty has always been self serving. He bashes Tom and management because it's his way of flexing power, letting off steam, and passive aggressively making threats which he can later play off as just a bit for interesting radio. Sure, the back office fights were always honest but they were never at his expense. Honesty means calling Gary an incompetent producer, calling Jackie a greedy hippie, calling Fred a weirdo loser, and constantly belittling everybody else Benjy, Stuttering John, Sal, Richard, Steve Brandano, etc. Howard has NEVER been honest in situations that made himself look bad. He has never revealed information about his private life that he truly finds embarrassing (How he ignored his kids growing up, how he probably cheated on his wife during the filming of Private Parts, how due to his narcissism he has incredible low self-esteem and jealously of everyone around him). He has never really been honest. He didn't talk about his relationship with Beth in the beginning, he lied for YEARS about his multiple plastic surgeries (he has admitted to the nose job and chin fat reduction, but he still lies about his chin implant, and his weave. It is inconceivable that a 61 year old man has long, thick, dark hair. He's full of it). People tolerated his multiple lies and secrets because he always delivered great radio. People forgave him because he was a radio genius... His mistake was just taking the lies to even greater levels. As the show got progressively worse, he was forced to lie and cover up more and more to prevent admitting his failures and embarrassment, which in turn led to the show becoming worse and more lies and more cover ups.\n",

      "Gender isn't one thing. It's lots of things all wrapped up together. Some of those things are social constructs, some aren't. Gender roles are part of the picture. This is the expectations that society puts on us based on how they perceive our gender. It tells women how to act like women, and men how to act like men, and punishes people that are perceived to be stepping outside of the limits of their role. This stuff is entirely a social construct Gender expression is part of the picture. This is how we as individuals choose to show (or not) our gender to the world, in the way we dress, and the way we act, and speak etc. It's probably social, but it could have biological elements too. Who knows? And finally, there's gender identity. This is simply whether we internally recognise ourselves as men, women, or something else. This is biological, this is the bit that makes someone transgender, and it's almost certainly just the way we're born. Of course, society influences how we understand our own genders, but the core part underneath it is there, no matter what society says or does.

As long as you're willing to pay for their replacement, it's not a huge deal. Coil overs are adjustable and allow you to dial in the ride height exactly how you'd like. They are ideal for aesthetic purposes, but they're also a bit more expensive. They'll also save you the cost of replacing your shocks more frequently. There is also a cost in terms of ride quality. Many lowering springs can preserve the softness of stock springs while lowering the ride height. Coilovers are usually more sport-focused and will make the car considerably stiffer. Remember that you're going to need an alignment after the springs are installed. This is an added cost that not many people think of, but it's absolutely necessary. In short, springs are the cheapest way to lower your car for looks. Coilovers are more performance oriented and require less maintenance.\n",

Seeing 2 of these major opposing forces, both with dreams of their own, will be amazing. The goal isn't about simply GETTING One Piece, it's the aftermath. What One Piece is and what it can accomplish. What the people in possession of it will do with it. (And it's not just a shit ton of money/ some devil fruits.)\n",

If someone tells me a story about a nurse being horrible to them and dismissing their problems at the front desk of their doctors office, I will usually stop them and say that was probably a receptionist, not a nurse. But if I go to the doctor for a check up and they tell me the nurse will be in to take my b/p and its an MA, I'm not going to get upset about it and call them out telling them they are not a nurse.

      "**Main idea:**I would basically try to replicate the Holocaust, just without the actual killing of certain groups, but the public will not know that. **How it will go:** I'll set up a totalitarian, fascist government while disguising myself as a symbolic, god-like dictator. The laws from before the collapse of the old government will remain. Religious believers of any religion besides Christianity and Catholic, people of color besides white or Latino, and people of any sexuality besides heterosexual will all be sent to isolated concentration camps with decent care for them to live in. Propaganda will be sent around to show all these groups as devilish or inferior. Loyal soldiers will be hired to enforce the law, arrest any rebels or inferiors without harming them, protect myself, and handle the camps. They will carry only tranquilizer guns, and metal guns will be outlawed by being taken away from the public. **Purpose:** It's to see if people have learned anything from history about not conforming to society and doing as they're told without skepticism which were some of the reasons why people like Hitler came to power because the public allowed them to have power and do as they wish. For once, people have the knowledge of what happened before and applying it by rebelling to prevent the situation a second time will be a dependent variable. It would also be interesting to see how the public can succeed in taking over the government when some odds are against them. **If the public succeeds:** I allow the government to collapse if the resistance is strong and let the people decide what the government would be as I make my escape by removing my disguise as the dictator. None of the prisoners would be harmed, so the public will be relieved to know that as they reconstruct their society. In conclusion, it's them who will be cleaning up the experiment. **If the public fails or does nothing:** The prisoners shall be freed, the government will weaken on itself, soldiers are forced to resign from duty, and I'll make my getaway by getting rid of the disguise. The society will be left abandoned to do whatever they want now that there is no government to bring order. If this does happen, it goes to show that people have learned nothing and will make the same mistake as before.\n",

      "Some cats don't really mind being alone. Some cats do. It's hard to tell in advance. Most cats I've known are pretty affectionate and they'll get lonely if you're gone all day. Being lonely doesn't usually make a cat upset, but sometimes they'll get into trouble to entertain themselves. Sometimes being alone all day stresses a cat out, and stressed cats do all kinds of weird things to try and calm themselves down. My suggestion would be to get two, if you can afford the space. They can (and will) share toys, litterboxes, and spaces, and they'll entertain each other by wrestling around and chasing each other. Sometimes they just like to watch each other, depending on their personalities. Since cats sleep most of the day, just knowing that they're not alone can be enough for them. Sometimes your cats will have really different personalities and they won't get along very well, but it's really, really rare for cats to seriously hurt each other. Cats in general are easy-going and pragmatic, and if they live in the same house they'll figure something out. If you really can't get two cats (and you don't have any other pets they might want to hang out with), just leave some toys around and they'll entertain themselves when you're gone, and then when you come home try and spend time playing with them.\n",

I have yet to talk to a teacher that every said a kid should not have to face consequences. Why does everything think that suddenly all the teachers, people trained on how to educate, all suddenly lost their minds and started creating spoiled kids? You also hear about helicopter parents going to their kids first job interview with them. If anything this is caused by desperate parents trying to make sure their kid is successful. Those parents do put pressure on schools for sure. The problem in the US is the income gap. People are desperate to make sure their kids do well in school because if they don't, they wont get into a good college and wont get a good job. You cant just finish high school and get a good job anymore. And IMO this inequality pushes eople to want to feel more equal and successful in other ways.

Yahweh thought he was the creator, but was not (which is a story buddhism often tells about gods that think this), and jesus was a holy being who was not yet enlightened in his incarnation as jesus but will be in his next incarnation. And so they worship jesus as a being who will incarnate as the next buddha, interpreting his story about life on earth as a story of his past life, and the story of his second coming as a description of when he will be enlightened. So it allows them to place jesus as the center being of the religion even though the religion is Buddhism rather than christianity. It simply takes the story of jesus and christianity and converts it into a format that can make jesus the next future buddha.

      "I'm so glad! I think you're completely right. I'm an ENFJ but I tend to test more as an ENFP when I am surrounded by other judgers. I have been overcontrolled in the past by people who are on the judging side so I've developed an aversion to those behaviors. In turn, that overcontrolling has led to one of my values being freedom, which looks like me shying away from other-generated order. Those that see me in everyday life would think I'm a perceiver because I hate rules, planning, and authority, but those who are able to see my personal decisions would know me to be a judger, as my overt behavior is simply a protective measure against others. And apart from all that, an extroverted judger looks much more like a perceiver compared to an introverted judger, as being around people and catering to their needs requires a lot of flexibility away from one's natural desire to make plans and organize. To add to the confusion, in Enneagram I test as a 2 (Helper), because I have socialized as a female to be caretaking, especially being the oldest child of a widowed father growing up. If I had taken the test during middle school I would have tested as a 4 (Individualist), because I dropped out of school to take care of siblings and was wrestling with identity issues. But if I go back further to my most default state, I am a 7 (Enthusiast), because enjoying the little things around me in this world matters most, that is when I have the emotional ability to even think about what matters most. So don't feel bad about the confusion. It's part of being a human: a composite of our personality, experiences, attachments, traumas, stresses, needs, values, etc. If anything, your compensating for social behaviors simply shows maturity on your part. The more we conform to the expectations and insecurities of our types, the less we grow and experience other perspectives in this world.\n",

      "if I understand you correctly, you wonder if a painting cannot tell a story because it's a still image? Something like a triptych or even a comic book doesn't even comform to this and I think that's certainly false, a painting can most certainly tell a story, just the story will not be played out in front of the observer's eyes, so it is a matter of inference a book can obviously tell a story can't it?. Similarly, the story is inferred by reading the text, the only temporal relation between each successive word on the page being that they are processed one after the other by the viewer. I suppose a painting can also tell the story of itself if you look beyond its subject and see it as an object *per se*. I remember seeing this painting in a gallery as a kid and pressing my face close to the glass trying to discern every little brushstroke an imagining the artist painstakingly making each one. That's certainly a story of sorts.\n",

      "Either is fine as a temporary measure but I'd personally prefer sod or turf to minimize confusion. Both will allow pup to use an indoor bathroom, both can be faded out later after pup is old enough to hold it. Sod is more similar to outdoors so less confusing, but is also fun to eat/dig when unsupervised. Pads are convenient, can cover an arbitrarily large area, can be held by a frame to keep them from being dug/chewed, usually have a puppy attractant scent, but look and feel similar to other cloth items in your house. Crating is a useful house training method but is not fair or helpful if you're gone so long the puppy can't hold it. I wouldn't crate for 5 hour stretches in the very beginning with a presumably 8 week old puppy...pup would necessarily pee in the crate, which is counterproductive. If you wanted to go the crating route you could get a friend/neighbor/walker to stop in for extra potty breaks during the day to prevent accidents. That would lead to minimal confusion and faster house training progress, just requires some coordination with the friend/neighbor/walker.

      "There is a wonderful technique called reframing you can do. The world is full of things we could pay attention to. However to keep from being overwhelmed we put a mental frame in front of ourselves and look only at what is in the frame. Say my head starts to hurt. I have a frame that concentrates my attention on this pain. I get caught up in it and react and deal with the rest of the world through it. But the good news is that I or you or anyone else can change the frame. I could make it bigger and notice that while my head hurts, my teeth don't which is wonderful. Not only that, my neck, my back, my kidney, my stomach, my toes and so on are all pain free. This makes my headache much less intense, threatening, and overwhelming. Or with a bit more practice I could shift the frame and get the headache out of the picture completely. So even if there is a sensation, it is not really registering as pain. Or for that matter I could take a super close look at the headache by shrinking the frame so that I see only a small part of the headache which would essentially deconstruct it into oblivion. Likewise (and much more easily) you can do this with the things that seem to engender the self-loathing. The first thing to do is just really nail what you are talking about down. What do you mean by basic, simple, and inadequate? What is the line between basic and advanced? Are there things that are more basic than what you are calling basic? Where did the idea that this thing is simple come from? Who told you it was simple? How simple is simple? In what way is it simple? How complex does it have to be before it is considered complex? Go through the same kinds of questions with inadequacy. What exactly quantitatively would be adequate? This will bring to your awareness the frame you are currently using. Once you know your frame you can change it. Make it bigger, smaller, shift it to something else and so on. Then the feeling of inadequacy whether coming from you or seemingly from somewhere else stop getting traction in your mind and heart and start to fade. I learned this from Buddhist mindfulness meditation, but I know the Neuro-Linguistic Programing (NLP) people are really into it too and are the ones that call it re-framing. Byron Katie teaches a brand of this called The Work( that is also worth checking out. She comes from a background of *severe* depression and so it is well suited for people actively suffering.\n",

I watched the composer cutscene again they vanish in the normal golden flakey light. I've seen that happen to my guy a trillion times in 5's multiplayer. It's not gory at all, it's not got limbs flying, heads exploding, it doesn't haven't any blood from what I see. Yeah you can make an argument that you can shoot dead marines and see blood fly, but even that is hugely PG. It's a bit of computer generated blood, I think anyone in third grade and beyond is capable to start to tell computer generation isn't real. Halo also have themes that are heavy, but they see it on the news all the time. I think themes shouldn't make a game M. I think showing actual blood and gore would be M. I know Halo has blood, but when compared to the average Horror movie, and or things like COD where you actually can shoot limbs off. It's not bad. Secondly Halo has very Teen language. Infact most teenagers are dropping F-bombs compared to maybe the occasional 'Damn' in Halo. Sex isn't there no matter who wants to say they can see Cortana's chest area she's really not flashing and she's clearly covered. So therefore you got heavy hitting topics, some gore, but no where near the average teenager has seen in his life, and more. I've always voted Halo as a T for teen game. I was playing Reach in High School, I was playing Halo 3 in 7th grade. I don't think you have to worry as much about Halo 5. It's definitely a step down in terms of graphic imagery*, but very much still the classic Halo gameplay just finally realized as a Teen game.\n",

I'm gonna approach from a different angle: mana curve. When I'm looking at your deck, I'm seeing a large amount of high CMC cards. A hand with several of those, even if you have sufficient lands, will leave you slow. What you might want to do, since you've played your deck a decent amount, is to pick the high CMC cards you generate the least value off of- ones you don't play, ones you don't tutor for, etc- and replace them with lower CMC cards. Throwing in some tutors would be helpful. So might adding some graveyard recursion. ​ Also, throw in \\\\Protean Hulk\\\\. Up to you if you want to throw in some other stuff that can combo off of it- that being said, \\\\Pili-Pala\\\\, \\\\Spikeshot Elder\\\\, and \\\\Grand Architect\\\\ is one of the best choices in Maelstrom Wanderer's colors.

      "When you say drawn to MBTI the most, what do you mean exactly? Intuitives in general are more likely to pursue MBTI because we seek our identities more precisely than other types. The fact that we're more withdrawn from our senses means that learning about ourselves is often a personal search for knowledge. Everyone needs to understand how to exist in this world but intuitives in general are more likely to pursue personality systems like MBTI. I believe NFs are probably the most likely since they are constantly in search of their own identity. NTs, secondarily, seek to understand their own personal strengths and weaknesses so we can control our behavior easier and understand others (like NFs) with great precision. Sensing types are consequently more likely to simply mimic other family members. Thus, often they do not see as strong a need to understand the theoretical framework behind human behavior.\n",

      "If you are interested in learning more about Christian Apologetics, I highly recommend Frank Turek's college lectures. You can find him on YouTube, he's covered many questions like this one. I take it from your comments that this question is implying more than the title states. Do you question the moral authority of God to kill the Egyptian infants? That's a reasonable question and one that many Christians struggle with, especially when reading passages like Exodus 12, or the extermination of the Canaanites. If Christianity is true, then people don't really die. They only change location. All we know is that the firstborn of Egypt died. We do not know what their eternal states were in the aftermath of Exodus 12. We can not say with certainty if those who were taken by God were given comfort in Heaven or damnation in Hell. Because I do not know what happened to the Egyptian souls, I choose to leave that judgement in God's hands. My question would be this: how many years do you believe everyone is entitled to on this earth? If a man dies at age 80, do we thank God for giving him a full life, or do we blame God for not letting him live to 90? If God is the Giver of Life, who has the authority to tell God how many years He is required to give? I'll also throw out a bit of speculation on my part, as I have spent quite a bit of time contemplating this issue. Perhaps others in this comment section will disagree, and I'd love to get a response. Who is to say that we need to live our lives fully for God to hold us responsible? If God knows our hearts, and knows our sins before we even commit them, can we say we are innocent before the act is committed? If God were to kill baby Hitler to prevent the Holocaust, would we demand Hitler enter the gates of Heaven? Should a man with that vile of a nature be rewarded with eternal life simply because he died before he could act our his nature? Would the Egyptian infants have turned out any different than their parents? I can't say, and again, I choose to leave the judgement of souls to God who knows all things.\n",

You consider saying hi, but it will never happen. You're far too shy for that to work. So you sit and watch instead. She pulls her hair into a tighter ponytail. You love how she swings it back and forth subconsciously. When the teacher asks a question, she sits up in her seat and primly looks over her answer. She raises her hand slightly, but the minute the teacher turns back around, she pulls it down. Someone else answers the question. You see her write a large blue checkmark on her paper. You wonder why she hadn't left her hand up. She'd clearly had the answer right! She slouches a bit in her seat and takes out a small notebook. She opens it to a new page and begins drawing little stick people. First there is a girl with hair pulled into a high ponytail. Next to her, she draws a shorter one with curly hair and a big smile on her face. You continue to watch her draw, until there are 20-something people drawn on her paper. She clicks her teeth as you watch her begin to label the people. About 13 stick figures in, you see her write a large A underneath the person. She writes the rest of your name underneath, and you realize she's drawn your math class. You love the way she drew you, with dark messy hair and a smile on your face. You begin to think about how you would draw her. *How could I capture her in just a little stick figure?* You think. But, before your brain can churn out any more thoughts, the bell rings. You grab your backpack and begin to leave Mrs. Hull's Algebra II class. Out of the corner of her eye, you see her slip her notebook into her bag and swing her bag over her shoulder.

I think I can be an attention whore in some eyes because I need to share on the intellectual level. I talk about what I think interesting and that is a lot of things. I often *try* ideas, insights and hypotheses out loud. My ISTP friend is often a good rubber ducky for that, and corrects me if I miss something which is very helpful (*and I should tell him more*). Perhaps he thinks that I try to manipulate him. Mostly because I gave him a lot of advice in the form of knowledge bits insights (*Hey, ya know grand apes have the same digestive system than humans, thus meaning we should eat like them, meaning raw fruits, roots and insects.*) and it seems to bother him *(not just neutral*). But I know he thinks his mother is manipulative too (*strong ESTJ*...). So what is manipulation in your eyes? We were in a weird sort-of low-emotion relationship. So it is rare that we share feelings about what we talk or even more about each other (*I don't know his dreams or his beliefs*). I miss it now because we are in an important moment in our lives (*independently*), and mostly because I start to grasp my lower **Fe** and he don't. Lately I feel he's very distant with me, but also his family (*I talk more with his mother than him*) or other friends (*some call him for weeks without answer*). He says he needs to resource which is OK, but I feel he wants to cut the link. Why? What can trigger this? How can I help him? Ask me anything, I am an open book or tell me anything, I am a blank page. Edit: reading your post about advises. I need another rubber ducky (*not because I don't like my friend*).\n",

      "I'm not affected romantically. I'm aromantic. Breakups don't weigh on me at all. The closest thing to it that I've cared about was when my best friend of ten years decided she didn't want to be my friend anymore- that hurt me. That sort of love, friend love, means more to me than anything else. I don't understand romantic love. It doesn't hurt me to lose it, because it doesn't do anything to me to have it. I don't want to be alone, but I don't want to be in a relationship either. I may be a cold heartless bitch on the outside, but in truth I don't like hurting people. I don't like being a heartbreaker. Being in a relationship with me will end with me feeling uncomfortable in the bounds of a romantic partnership and I'll eventually break up with them. So therefore, I shouldn't be in romantic relationships. However as aforementioned, I don't want to be alone. Ideally I would find other aromantics and we could all be roommates/neighbors. But I may also be able to make it work with a romantic bow (bow being the word equivalent to boyfriend/girlfriend for arrowmantics, our committed partners), which is what I am thinking about attempting. I'll see how it goes, maybe it'll work with a romantic person, but more likely they'll get all obsessed with their SO and stop being as good of a friend (which is the common problem for aromantics, and our worst nightmare) and I'll have to start over. But that's okay. As I get older I'm sure I'll make methods of how to find other aromantics or romantics capable of maintaining the sort of closeness I desire even in their romantic partnerships. Also, if everyone could stop saying I'll find **the one** someday that'd be spectacular. I don't want to change, I'm happy as I am, thank you very much, world. Also, finally talked my ENTJ mother into believing me about my aromanticism! I feel so cool. Not every day you can change an Ni lead's mind about something they can't comprehend.\n",

They formulate a thought in their head and then need to translate it into a verbal sentences. You should notice a pause, particularly with INTJs, as if they were thinking in Spanish first, then translating that into English and then saying it. You can also notice Ni by the lack of Ne. Ne is drawing connections between things, doing so fast, actively. That said, it is not all that visible in INTPs I do not have a good theory for that. Ni absorbs information in and digests it later. If someone claims to know something but cannot quite explain how or why, then they are probably an Ni user. You know, just as secondary or even lower Ne is much less visible, same goes for Ni. If half of the people in the room were ENTPs and the rest INTJs, then telling which ones have Ne and which ones have Ni should be pretty easy. In other less obvious cases this should be harder to do. **EDIT:** forgot all about the INFJs the other Ni doms. Sorry but I am not sorry.\n",

On a more day to day basis, Ni doms will oftentimes not notice or remember physical details, such as exact numbers, what color somebody was wearing, when the last time they ate was, and so on. They simply don't feel any of this is really important and have a natural tendency to ignore it, and will often have to put a lot of energy into remembering to observe it. Due to the way Ni works, they also will naturally skip over information that doesn't seem to immediately fit with their vision, unlike Ne or higher Se users who will generally consider all information equally.

Sorry to hear that, but again, neither side is valid since it is anecdotal, unless you found a large Christian denomination that supported it (I can find plenty that support my side), there is no real evidence. Alot of hate against Obama does come from racist people, but you are generalizing that since many people are not mad at his skin or even think of it. People are mad that he doesn't acknowledged their god for some reason, and if he did it would in result offend dozens of religious groups. For the first part, that is the prevailing theory of why Obama received that much pre-election hate that probably has surpassed any amount of hate for an elected PotUS. It might be people looking for any reason to dislike him because of their underlying prejudices, while they don't openly know it or admit it. If it's not the racism that is underlying, then it's definitely racists that fuel the turning of disagreements with him into hatred. There's really not much else that can be singled out here as the cause. Second half of your statement: you make a valid argument, but that's probably not even a quarter of the hate. Note: I live in a rural red-state, Bible Belt town, go to a Southern Baptist church, and I went to a conservative Christian high school, so I think I would be very likely to run across these types often, but I don't. Very few, if any, are mad at him for religious reasons except for the nutjobs that would believe it if you told them that he was a robot. Most of us don't give a single fuck about what religion our president is as long ancient ideas/practices come into factor in their decisions. Possibly so, but probably the same ratio of atheists are mad that he is a Christian as there are religious that are mad at him being tolerant. /r/christianity moderators are awful. I have awful memories of that hellish place. They delete posts left and right that go against the bible. No, they don't. Read any good thread with discussion from both sides. They only delete bigotry that commonly flows into the subreddit. Usually, now they will leave things undeleted if it is buried. The problem with a good number of the r/atheism subscribers is that they will come in and troll everyone, mock them, spew hate, and claim that the Christians have low intelligence. This gets upvoted en masse by similar trolls, who would cross-post their own perceived wit and moderator oppression to r/atheism. This hinders any real Christian discussion, which is what the community is for. Heck, I could go into TwoX and post stuff about male rights all day and say how women get too many rights (not what I believe, but just go with it), but I would get banned, as that is the opposite of what the community is for, and what they represent. Also, look into r/christianity. There are plenty with the atheist flair that comment regularly there. Atheistic comments are very welcome, as long as they aren't bigoted.\n",

To make massacre seem good, you have to ironically answer with bonds type answers, yet take massacre, which leads them to respond more positively to you siding with it. Not that you are too positive about being killed, but you know. The problem with dagda is that he simply didn't seem like a plausibly good enough character, nor even you on that ending well intentioned enough to spin as good in the ways you are meant to be allegedly able to. His ending just seemed too negative, and his own ideology too incoherent that you more or less have to ignore everything he says and just focus on the power you are being given.

      "pardon the entirely UN-scientific notions here. but my sense of relationships is that they have a sort of energy to them. each person in the relationship/group contributes their own pieces to the whole. personally, I've very sensitive to negativity. take dinner plans for instance: want chinese? no. indian? no. any kind of asian? no. burgers? no. by now I'm about spent. I hate the game of 'I'll keep saying things and you keep shooting them down.' in this example, I'm not hungry would have been fine, or even better yet, actually make a suggestion. for me at least, this sort of negativity wears on me. I'm an upbeat person and always will be, but after a point it feels like I'm just tossing things at a brick wall that'll never move. after awhile I stop making suggestions at all, because it's easier. and eventually in time, the negativity wins. bad days are okay, we all have them. depression, even, is a whole different ball game. but constantly negative... that I can't do. (conversely, I find myself naturally sort of almost encouraging ENFPs to keep being themselves. love 'em to death. despite being an INTJ. it's not in my nature to jump up and dance with you, but once you start dancing, and turn and look back to me, I'll nod at you keep going!)\n",

      "You're in Ohio too, which has a good spread of public universities. I don't plan on staying in Ohio. I want to move to British Columbia or Oregon. Just keep your grades up and don't slack off when it comes to SAT/ACT prep and you'll have plenty of options, especially if debt isn't going to be a concern The next two years are probably going to be a lot easier because I'm going to a career prep school that structures things a bunch differently, but right now my grades are terrible. It's like Ds across the board other than in respects to super easy classes. I normally do well on standardized testing but I'm really awful at test prep and studying. It sounds like right now your main problem is social isolation: the fact that you're shy/anxious compounds with the logistical difficulty of actually getting places (since there's no transit and you have to rely on your parents to drive you), so you wind up not having many opportunities to meet people, which means you don't have many opportunities to become more confident with social interaction and eventually get less shy/anxious. This is an extremely common problem for high schoolers in suburban to rural areas. Yeah. This is spot on. Luckily, this is also the exact problem that the American-style residential college rite of passage excels at fixing. So when you're looking for colleges, in addition to the usual considerations like can I get in and can I afford it, also prioritize schools with active social scenes where it'll be easy for you to meet people and avoid social isolation (like, say, Ohio State) in spite of your natural shyness. God I hope so. Can I get in is my main concern right now though, honestly, because my grades are... Well, I already said. Bad. Probably better in the future because different schools that does things differently, but still.\n",

I've been doing it for two years now, the community loves me, but I am feeling the itch to move on. It's not very financially lucrative. I don't need much but I need a bit more than this. Also, I have a creative streak that has been put on hold. I get so caught up in running the shop that I don't get any creative outlet. Makes me feel like I'm not evolving as a human, at a standstill.

      "DUDE. I'm female and 18 too, and I wwoofed in Oregon and Washington before heading up to Canada (I'm Canadian) and wwoofed there as well. I went to 5 different farms in total and had the time of my life. I can see why your mom would be worried initially, but there are some tips you can follow to make sure you'll be safe. Firstly, as a general rule, don't go to any farms that are run by single men... Unless you meet them before hand, know and trust them. Second, once you read the profile and establish that it's a place you really want to go, CALL THEM. I found that by phone conversations with the main person, I could immediately get a sense of how we got along together, if they sounded easygoing or strict and uptight (sometimes they immediately lay down the rules, info, etc. And I avoid places like that cause it's too uptight for me). Make sure you feel they are warmly welcoming you on the phone. You can subconsciously pick up a lot by the sound of someone's voice. Listen to your gut feeling. Lastly, I personally always ask if there are other wwoofers there, and what they are like. Age, sex, interests. If there's other wwoofers around and it's a bad situation, you can keep yourself safer by helping eachother. Here's the thing though: most wwoof farms are legit. Not all of them, but by far majority. You'll be absolutely fine if you trust your gut :)\n",

That you need the tool isn't the reason. If you want to manipulate people to reach the top of a social hierarchy to be the alpha male in some sense, that's the wrong way to do it, because the moment you slight someone that's when you get ostracised.

I know that sounds great fun but it's a mental illness for a reason, their life is hell, it has no stability and their actions are nothing but a means of lashing out against themselves. You may think they have no empathy, but the evidence shows that they have *more* empathy than everyone else, which is why they are so good at manipulating people, they feel every bit of pain they inflict on others. If that's the reason and you really want to climb that ladder, then you have to learn to negotiate with the needs of other people, you don't trick them because you need their respect, and trust me they will find out at some point if you do trick them. The main trait that determines your success in this is conscientiousness if you look around at the people you respect the most, you'll find they are bursting at the seams with this quality. They are also very generous and it pays off because they surround themselves with similarly generous people, it's a much better way to live.\n",

      "It is helpful actually. I get a bit intensive actually with research to a fault. I do have to take notes and often write things down as I have a tendency to come up with a good connection while researching and then forget it if I don't record it right away. I often times have to use bookmark manager extensively for projects as I'll forget later unless I look at the bookmarks to remind myself. But I blame that on ADD sorta as I'm just absent minded about some stuff. I'm horribly absent minded sometimes, which results in silly things like opening up the freezer to cook and finding the salt I was looking for earlier to cook dinner. Or my habit of losing my keys all the time. That college actually sounds pretty fun really. I like going into depth about stuff and when I was in high school I spent a lot of time looking into global warming. I enjoyed finding the science behind it and the dismissive attitude on reddit about global warming kinda annoys me. Off-topic, I wonder why the hate for global warming is as such. Certainly the mechanics behind it are very demonstrable and solid. It frustrates me. I love my science classes and earth science was pretty useful in understanding not only the mechanics of global warming but other related topics. I'm actually up in the air between therapist and neuroscience. Part of me worries that I'm too highly affected by the emotions of others to be an effective therapist as you have to deal with the emotions of a lot of people who are in very difficult situations. Edit: Also on the topic of my writing... I stick to short stories because my writing flaw is that I like to write in bursts so unless I make good notes and an outline of my story I tend to forget. Which is why I make outlines and keep track of various things. My organization skills actually revolve a lot around that trait. I have no problem with plot, but I have problems filling in details at times. I like showing, not telling but sometimes I don't include enough environmental descriptions.\n",

      "It's called aromantic, right? If you want to have sex, you are not asexual. There's two types of attraction, romantic and sexual. Neither of which have to do with actually getting pleasure from sexual acts. You could, for instance, have someone who's not attracted to anyone sexually, still receives pleasure from sexual acts, but is then attracted to men/women romantically. Though my only experiences with asexual people (my sister and my friend) both are not interested in sex at all, and are just romantically attracted to other women. I was a late bloomer and I wasn't that much into sex when I was young. I knew sex was fun and stuff, but it wasn't all that was on my mind (contrary to popular belief that all teenagers are super horny all the time). That didn't make me asexual, though I actually matched that kinda thing. I wasn't sexually attracted to anyone when i was younger, but I was horny af. Turns out I had repressed my sexual attraction towards men. Why they want to put labels on themselves so much? You dont want to be in a relationship? You must be aromantic!!! You dont feel like you want to partake in a sexual interaction right now? Ace! Oh, I do want to have sex and be in a relationship (because, I dont know my life is in this place right now) I HAVE TO BE A-SEXUALLY, A-ROMANTICALLY, GENDERFLUID QUEER PERSON.

      "Copied from a comment where I was explaining why it wasn't necessarily hypocritical to believe in extraterrestrials and not God. Of course, in the case of dark matter the science requiring it's existence is there. Absolutely everything, including whether you accept the reality you are currently in, requires a leap of faith. The reasonableness of your taking that leap of faith depends on whether it is necessary (it is perfectly reasonable for you to accept that there is the universe that you experience simply because you know nothing else could exist or any reason why it doesn't) or likely (It may not be necessary for me to believe that the government isn't a huge conspiracy trying to control us maliciously to milk me of my product but it seems more likely that it's at least not malicious than that it is). Belief in science is based at least on the fact that, like government, it is more likely that it is not a huge conspiracy. There is probably no-one is laughing behind my back at the fact that I accept Newtonian physics and that there can be other things that I don't know of or understand that are there and necessarily explain the stuff that happens (like my laptop switching on). Religion is unnecessary (this is a controversial statement, of course) in explaining the universe that we experience. Science, which is likely to be real and thus is reasonable to believe in, has shown nothing to suggest that it it necessary and there is no evidence for it being true and so it is unreasonable to make the assumption that religion is true. Aliens, whilst not necessary in the explanation of what we experience (this is disputed by some, of course) are... Well, this depends on the science. If I'm honest, I'm not 100% sure about this. But in my understanding (which is above average) there is a reasonable likelihood that there are or will be or have been extraterrestrials in the universe somewhere at some point. If this is correct, it is not hypocritical to believe in extraterrestrials but not God since the former requires a lesser leap of faith than the latter. Personally, I take the fact that it is better logically to limit your leaps of faith as far as possible to mean that I should avoid an opinion on extraterrestrials beyond 'yeah, it would be cool if there were'. If this understanding of the science is not correct, and there is more reason to believe that humans are completely unique amongst everything than not then it is hypocritical. But the science, as I know it supports the view that it is not hypocritical to accept that there are (were or will be) extraterrestrials but not that there is a God.\n",

      "I grew up in a pretty generic evangelical setting, and had all of the theological accoutrements that come with that kind of background. One of those things was the eschatology (read: rapture), though I didn't give it too much thought for the first 20 years or so of my life. It wasn't until I was around 21 when I met my (now) ex-wife. As it turns out, her mother is a *nut* about eschatology and conspiracy theories and the like. She's a pentecostal/charismatic type, has *literally* spent the past 17-18 years with her nose buried in books and websites about the end times, the Illuminati, reptilian people, FEMA camps, yadda yadda yadda. Anyway, she really fed on fear and things like that, and took my eschatological understanding that I had pushed to the back of my mind and drew it to the front. I spent about a year and a half in fear and anguish because I believed everything she said was true (I didn't know better at the time). Then by way of some innocuous conversation with some pastor friends of mine, I decided to start exploring what the ancient church(es) have always believed. Not just in eschatology either, but in soteriology, Christology, Mariology, hamartiology, etc etc. I've always loved theology but up until that point my study of it had been limited to a few subject areas. I started expanding, and became pretty well-versed in what, as St. Vincent of Lrins put it, has been believed everywhere, always, and by all. From that point on I was seen by my ex-MIL as an adversary and that's actually a significant reason why I'm divorced today. TL;DR Was raised on a weak understanding of premillennial/dispensational eschatology including a belief in the rapture, it was really inflated when I first met my ex-wife's mom and then about a year after that I studied and adopted the ancient and prevailing views (amillennialism), and re-evaluated my position on several theological viewpoints, now leaning more towards Catholicism and Orthodoxy than anything else.\n",

Plus, teaching yourself could lead to much more clutch wear, though learning in general is still gonna do more wear anyway. As far as shifting, I think you may like it.

      "Let's allow the full quote and his explanation speak for itself: Libertarianism has a special meaning predominantly in the United States. In the United States, it means dedication to extreme forms of tyranny. They dont call it that, **but its basically corporate tyranny, meaning tyranny by unaccountable private concentrations of power**, the worst kind of tyranny you can imagine. It picks up from the libertarian tradition one element, namely opposition to state power. But it leaves open all other forms of and in fact favors other forms of coercion and domination. So its radically opposed to the libertarian tradition, which was opposed to the master servant relation. Giving orders, taking orders thats a core of traditional anarchism, going back to classical liberalism. So its a special, pretty much uniquely American development and related to the unusual character of the United States in many respects. America is to quite an unusual extent a business-run society. Thats why we have a very violent labor history. Much more so than comparable countries, and attacks on labor here were far more extreme. There are accurate libertarian elements in the United States, like protection of freedom of speech, which is probably of a standard higher than other countries. But libertarianism is designed in the United States to satisfy the needs of private power. Actually, its an interesting case in connection with the media. The United States is one of the few countries that basically doesnt have public media. I mean, theoretically, theres NPR, but its a highly marginal thing and is corporate funded anyway. So theres nothing like the BBC here. Most countries have something or other. And that was a battleground, especially when radio and television came along. The Founding Fathers actually were in favor of different conceptions of freedom of speech. Theres a narrow conception which interprets it as being a negative right, meaning you should be free of external interference. Theres a broader conception which regards it as a positive right: you should have a right to impart and access information, hence the positive interpretation. The United Nations accepts the positive interpretation, and theoretically, the US does too. If you look at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I think Article 19 says that every person must have the right to express themselves without constraint and to impart and receive information over the widest possible range. Thats the positive right. That was a battleground in the 1930s and 1940s. Particularly right after the Second World War, there were high level commissions taking both sides. And the position that won out is what was called corporate libertarianism, meaning corporations have the right to do anything they want without any interference. But people dont have any rights. Like you and I dont have the right to receive information. Technically, we can impart information if we can buy a newspaper, but the idea that you should be a public voice that people, to the extent that this societys democratic and participatory, was eliminated in the United States. And thats called libertarianism. Meaning mega-corporations can do what they like without interference.\n",

      "General advice; As MBTI users, we can use our knowledge of others to our advantage to make communication easier/more efficient. If you want someone to do something, think about who you are speaking to. Thinkers are swayed by facts, reason, and logic; 2+2. Feelers are swayed by feelings, whether their own or someone elses; offended, stressed, excited. You may need to change your argument to target the other person. **xxTJ** You will always get more ants with honey than vinegar. I know you think it's stupid, but you need to be aware of others feelings. People will be more inclined to do what you want without complaint if you make them feel good. Therefore, you need to chose your words carefully. HOW you say things is just as important, if not more so, than WHAT you are saying. Be patient with the feelings of others. **xxFx** Just because you are feeling a strong emotion, does not mean that the other person is going to understand or be sympathetic. If you want to get something done (rather than just venting) and are talking to one of the above types, avoid using the words I'm feeling, I don't like, etc. Because they rely so heavily on logic, they tend to automatically disregard everything you say when they know you're basing your rationale on emotions. Do your research. Come to the table with facts. Speaking their language will get you much further and frustrate you less. If you cannot come up with step-by-step reasoning on why you want or don't want something, then maybe you need to re-evaluate your emotions.\n",

After *he* tells *her* she's Taylor Shaw, he says: *We had a creek at the back of our house. Used to go fishing there with my dad. We didn't catch much, but I loved being out there. My sister was always inside, playing with her dolls, but you were a tomboy. Anytime I was outside, you'd run out of your house and try to tag along. We had this little wooden fort. I haven't thought about that for a long time.* Later, when Bill asks Taylor to tell them a story, Jane simply regurgitates a story Weller told her long before Oscar ever shared those photos -- which makes the whole mess even more Weller's fault! I still think his over-the-top, hyper-emotional, incredibly irrational behavior at the end of the finale was justified (albeit completely unfair to Jane) but I guess I never realized before just *how much* of this was his fault.\n",

They get their own provider-independent (PI) space, advertising it out through their upstream(s) SPs do have a point when they get their first customer move order which breaks the hierarchy they've imposed on their PA space. Don't assume you'll be able to have any better aggregation internally with v6 than v4. Someone will statically assign IPs and complain loudly about the additional work they've imposed on themselves. If I remember correctly, in IPv4, provider-independent address blocks are frowned upon by ISPs. And you might have to pay more to get service with that address block or might even be denied due to increased routing overhead. Not sure where you got that impression. Have your own IP space? That's one less thing for us to allocate and track. A prefix is a prefix is a prefix in BGP, so there is no additional routing overhead. One could argue that PI space can't be aggregated so it's another prefix in the global routing table, but both PA and PI space need to be floating around *your* ISP's network, so it's still +1 prefix to the company you're paying.\n",

Personally I have no problem with someone getting fired to make room for me (family or otherwise) in a general sense, because I'd also expect to be fired if I wasn't a valuable enough asset. But if someone was a hard worker and getting fired just because they didn't like the person or something, then I wouldn't want to work for that company anyway.

      "Its considered a safe haven just like the US and Swiss are considered safe havens. Correct, when doing a carry trade you borrow x currency at a low interest to buy y currency with a high interest. So borrowing Yen to buy USD would weaken the Yen exchange rate. However you do not have to wait for anything to mature nor do you have a principle. With a currency carry trade, you are not investing into any bonds. Instead you're just looking to capitalize on the interest rate differential. Also, exchange rates are not strictly determined by carry trades. You are correct in that if the currency you have bought moves significantly against you, then you could end up with losses that outweigh the interest earned. In the forex, a carry trade is all about the interest rate and typically you want to borrow a currency with the lowest interest rate and buy the highest interest rate currency. Consequently people are using the Yen to fund carry trades in AUD. I do not see any reason why a person would want to do a carry trade using Yen and buy USD considering you can get a much higher interest rate with AUD. Every day you collect interest on your carry trade (even over the weekend). If you are able to get in on the carry trade at the beginning before other investors your odds of making money from the trade and from the interest are much higher. When doing carry trades in the forex, you have to pay attention to the central banks of the two currencies your using. Any interest rate changes can affect your carry trade. At which point a re-evaluation of the carry trade is necessary. As for the fukushima stuff, I heard the unwinding was because a lot of Japanese insurance companies needed to repatriate money back home from abroad to pay for insurance claims. I am not a Japanese investor. But if I was, I would be buying Australian assets.\n",

Another way of thinking of it is that the focus and self-control required to do your work are being drained at a slightly faster rate than they are being replenished. What I would suggest is to work more of the mindless activities into your schedule earlier on, potentially forgoing a subject or extracurricular activity if needed to make them fit. If there is no way to add such activities, then ADHD medications or SSRIs/SSNRIs may be a way to artificially boost your ability to handle stress. However, given that any medication can have severe side-effects and that finding the right medication can take a significant amount of time, it is usually best not to make medication your first choice.\n",

My wife has been sexually abused early teens by a sibling and once I found out about that it all seemed to fit. Her controlling nature, is a way of her protecting herself from harm. Because if she's always in control, then if she gets hurt she can only be hurt by herself, and more stuff like that. She had had EMDR and claimed she was over it, and maybe that's true, but she still has all the coping mechanisms and behavior from someone who was traumatized. Just saying this because when I read your post the thing you said about filling a need she can't really define herself and having problems being happy within herself were also the dominant factors with my ex-wife. So, maybe there has been abuse in her past, or a trauma? Good luck anyways, and remember that only she herself can fix these demons of her. Be careful not to dive in deep and try and fix it for her, or push her. You are of course totally in your right to at some point decide you can't/don't want to be in this anymore. But just don't become a doormat. Edit; And if there's trauma in her past, or she's been abused, do get help for yourself as well. This will help you cope with it better if you decide to stay.\n",

Of course not, because high quality gear, that is well maintained, is unlikely to fail. It's the same with optics.

So humans end up having no idea that what they are being paid to do is actually harmful, or at least a waste of their talents, time, energy, etc. It's only when we are free to judge the value of our work for ourselves, using our internal programming for what's good and bad for life, that we grow as as species. Money gets in the way of us knowing what's good. I can pay you to make/sell junk food, and you might be convinced that what you're doing is a valuable service.

This is where Rotman's is And this would be your walking route from Rotman's to Chinatown( The pin is a Vietnamese restaurant called Pho Hung which is very affordable, averaging about $7-14 CAD for a meal (low end meals $7 CAD, such as fast food or Chinese food, high-end food such as steaks and fancier cuisine ranks $20-25, All You Can Eat Sushi on Friday nights are typically $28-32). Pho Hung is the northernmost corner of China Town, lots of sidewalk groceries which are excellently priced and fresh. Some notable shops in China town (which I'll leave you to google): Dragon City Mall, a small Asian plaza; Kinton Ramen, which is south of U of T and a bit pricy, but completely authentic and delicious; Dim Sum King on Dundas street because omgggg; and AnimExtreme, if you're into that. To the west of that immediately is Kensington Market( arguably the hippest of Toronto's locale. Lots of marijuana, so if you're not into that, just be warned. My pin is the Blue Banana, which is a very interesting, eclectic shop FILLED with cool stuff. Great for souvenirs too, so if you're heading back to UK, you could drop by here and grab some gifts. Our equivalent to Debenham's is Hudson's Bay at Eaton's Centre( Eaton's Centre is the largest mall in downtown Toronto, lots of big-brand stores. The foodcourt isn't bad either. Hudson's Bay is $$, so unless you want to spend, then this pin is to show you how to walk to Eaton's. If you know where you're about to settle down to live, hit me up, because I can find you local food :) If you want sights and interesting locations around Toronto Greater Toronto Area, let me know too.

      "Well there-in lies the problem that this post was bringing up. I am not willing to meet people half way. Did it for too long just to be shit on. I cannot be arsed making myself being more unhappy on the slim chance that someone will understand, when the majority of the time they won't understand. And socialising doesn't create the happiness at all. It creates upset and discomfort and often hurt. So why fake interests for a small chance? I've suggested multiple times for other interests (it's worth saying there's only 3weeks left in the course so I've given up all trying at this point, but over the years I did try) and I was often scoffed at. You have to understand, the drinking culture here is a huge thing. It's basically the only thing to do. There is no other options. Also, I believe I came off as weird. The friend I have example of, it wasn't an interviewer situation, but either way, I felt and still feel it was the only way to deal with the situation. Would you want a friend who would do that to you? I honestly don't want a friend that would do that, hence why I said it to her. Obviously honesty is not wanted, I'm aware of that, and I do use it in tact. I don't use it in blunt hurtful ways. But people just seem scared of someone who is willing to be honest. It's such a foreign concept to most people, that when they meet someone who is comfortable enough to *be* honest. So regardless of how it's said/used people just run from it. I would say in certain groups I would come off as cold and closed, but not at first. I have suffered with MH problems, depression anxiety etc. and when it's brought up in conversation over time it is often remarked that I am so out going and that there's not a hint of anxiety. So I don't think that the first impression comes off as closed. So I really can't put a finger on it.\n",

      "Yeah. Adults say things like you don't have serious problems. But that's not really true. Bullying and abuse is common among those ages. The feeling of isolation from no friends. The crisis of identity of being between a kid and an adult. One thing that happens is that they realize that they are losing interest in kid things, but don't totally know what they might like later on. This makes some depressed who think they really are just losing interests to begin with. Also the crisis of identity and shame that comes from their parents still treating them like kids, but expecting them to have adult responsibilities. The emotional suffering that comes from various interactions with other people is very real. And adults who trivialize it are exacerbating the problems. Since it really *is* true that those people don't really understand their kids. Not only that, but if its true that people at a certain age suffer more for smaller problems... that doesn't mean that they aren't suffering. Because the real thing to look at is the suffering level, not the problem as if it existing distinctly from the people it effects. So people are ironically saying things that aren't even an excuse to ignore them, yet using it as one. When these same people still go on treating the same types of problems as problems as an adult. But convince themselves they earned the right to consider their problems real, whatever that means. The truth is that a lot of older people have a bias against treating younger people like real people. And a lot of problems result from this. Teenagers who have most of their thoughts dismissed, yet are still expected to follow orders have reason to think their lives are being trivialized.\n",

      "Sure Emmy Noether observed (via mathematics) that the conservation of energy is a direct result of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. It's hard to really conceptualize without thinking about it for a long time, but the way I think about it is this: Imagine a particle moving in a straight line at a fixed velocity. Newton's laws say that the particle will continue travelling with its fixed velocity in the absence of an external force. What would it look like for energy not to be conserved for this particle? Either its mass would change, or it would speed up/slow down. If the laws of physics changed over time, then this would certainly be possible. Maybe after a while, conservation of mass decides not to hold, and the particle gets heavier with no work. Or the particle changes speed without an external force. These would both be violations of the conservation of energy. It's hardly a mathematical proof, but hopefully it carries the message that these ideas (unchanging laws of physics energy conservation) are related. PS: One reason Emmy Noether is so awesome is that she didn't just do this for energy conservation. Noether's Theorem also shows that momentum conservation emerges from the fact that the laws of physics are the same no matter where you are, and angular momentum conservation comes from the fact that the laws of physics are the same no matter how you are oriented in space.\n",

HV Automatic: A prototype automatic weapon that fires electro- static pellets at a high rate Seems a bit generic to me. I'd go for something like an arc welder or a tesla baton or something. HV-320 Long-range suppressing unit: A battle rifle armed with a taser unit capable of launching multiple stunning darts via lock on, prioritizing larger targets This seems like a weak combination of the Seeker Six and Rail Gun. What about doing a battery rifle instead? Combat defibrillator: A portable defib unit that can be used to revive dead survivor at 50% HP or stun n deal massive damage to ZEDs at close range (30 seconds cooldown) Too powerful.

It was never designed to do anything more than evaluate your decision making and information gathering tendencies, which can highlight blind spots you might have in how you approach problems. It just so happens that people with similar MBTI 's (who do an actual test, not some online quiz) have similar personalities more often than not.

      " The most recent Census Bureau data showed that median household income what people in the exact middle of the American spectrum earn is $53,657. This touched on something that I tend to see often -I disagree with this article's attempted definition of the middle class as people near median income. NYT is trying to claim that the middle class equals the median income, and since 50k/yr is the median income, 50k/yr is therefore the center of middle class. This seems to be a common thing I'm seeing in articles. However, the term middle class never referred to the median income. Look up the origins of the term. If middle class were median income, it'd be impossible for the middle class to shrink. The fact that median wages aren't increasing with costs is making less people middle class, not making the middle class poorer. Middle class historically refers to a socioeconomic status. White collar workers and professionals doctors, engineers, lawyers, middle managers, etc. People working skilled jobs that can afford to own their own home. In some regions, 50k might do that easily. (Keep in mind, two people working at $12/hr full time is 50k/yr). However, I think in most regions, 50k/yr is lower middle class, maybe even working class. 250k is a serious grey area. I'd consider 250k/yr upper middle class in expensive regions (Bay Area, Manhatten) where your home is eating half your income and an apartment costs a million, but I'd consider it rich in lower income regions where it's more than the median cost of a home. (If your annual income exceeds the value of a nice home, you should be able to retire within a few years of work unless you live like a king.) Tl;dr: middle class doesn't mean average. It means able to own a house, cover your healthcare, have a nice car and not live paycheck to paycheck. Wages have stayed stagnant but the middle class has been declining because less and less people fall in to this category.\n",

      "FPTP encourages two party voting, where by giving your vote to a party that actually represents your views, but has no chance of winning prevents a party which shares some of your views from being elected, resulting in a party which shares none of your views being elected. Yes, but this only really applies to swing states. A lot of states can be easily predicted to vote one way or the other -- California hasn't voted for a Republican since Reagan, Texas hasn't voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 -- and don't really offer much of a choice to begin with. If you're a Republican in Massachusetts, you're pretty much screwed since the national vote doesn't mean anything. A single vote won't determine anything in most cases. The rationale for voting for a third party in a non swing state is either to vote your conscience or to try to get the third party to 5% nationally, which would make them eligible for getting federal funding and is a huge milestone for them. This thinking only applies to non swing states though. If you're in Florida or Ohio, voting for the lesser evil may be your better choice. But even there, you're personal vote doesn't really matter that much. Five percent of the electorate voting their conscience though, this can make a difference if past races are any indicator.\n",

So the connected me with the Dodge Dart project manager which I ended up selling it too (for a too low of price.. hah). So that was awesome! Anyway, thanks again! =)\n",

The best thing you can do is being yourself (since I think INTPs would be plenty interesting and share a common love of deep intellectual discussion), and showing appreciation acceptance when they show you a new facet of themselves and not rejecting that in anyway (otherwise they'll shut you out, and then you start over from zero). This might require slightly engaging with emotion from time to time, which I heard INTPs struggle greatly with (but showing the effort is important, I'm sure the INFJ would highly cherish that).

If I'm not mistaken, most american Krav Maga schools only do disarms with compliant partners, who leave their arm out for you to grab. At least I've seen people complaining about that, and how unrealistic that aspect of training is. Normally you can expect some MMA sparring with simple techniques that beginners can pick up quickly, and excessive emphasis on larping with dirty fighting. Some experienced, competitive martial arts people still find it worthwhile for the situational awareness and scenario training though, which seems to be the best available. If the teacher is decent, it's not at all bad, and some like the overall atmosphere better than an MMA gym. I mean that FMAs do lots of training where it's 1v1 and both fighters have sticks. Well yeah, it's primarily a stick fighting art. FMA is to stick fighting what BJJ is to ground fighting. Both do teach a few techniques outside their specialty, but really you'd be better off cross training for that. Depending on how the sticks are used, they can represent blades (knives, machetes) or literally sticks (short, long). You can tell by whether or not the fighters try to grab each other's sticks; you wouldn't want to do that with blades.\n",

This is essentially trusting you as someone that will not misunderstand their weak Fe attempts at bonding on an intellectual level via shared Ne. I'm not going to pretend to be able to make a typing judgement on your ex based on a few sentences, but the INTP-ENFP relationship in theory will end up in the ENFP feeling like they are never intellectually good enough to meet the approval of their INTP partner.

Outside of music, I don't allow any driving distractions (not even the radio), I keep constant check of my surroundings, I don't tailgate, I always use turn signals (always!), always check my blindspot religiously, I never do last-second lane changes, but on any given day, I'm probably going 5-10 (usually not more than 10) mph over the speed limit. The thing is, is I'm not going to sit behind a slow car. That's just not safe as I will probably unconsciously creep closer and closer, so if it's a two lane (same direction) road, I'll pass em. If it's a one lane road, I weep and bemoan my misfortune, and make sure I keep a safe distance back. But if it's a highway? I'll keep changing lanes to move past other people. It's nothing personal, I'm just moving at a faster pace so I'm doing the legwork and moving around y'all. I make sure I'm not weaving though I only ever change one lane at a time, and I always stay in that lane for at least 3 seconds before another change. I say all this because, I really don't get the smug attitude from the slower cars. Keeping in mind that I'm not the asshole tailgating and honking and shit, but I see these people get so happy at someone else's misfortune of being stuck behind a slow car, and I think it's kinda fucked.

      ". If we are assuming the people having a couple are committed and aren't cheating then how is it hurtful to her character? I'm lost on that Because by asking for a paternity test you're bucking that assumption. You can't say I know that you've been faithful to me but I think there's a chance you might not have been. That's a contradiction. Asking for a paternity test implies that some part of you, even if it's a teeny tiny microscopic part, thinks she may not have been faithful. There is no getting around that, at all. Fair enough. My argument is her feelings don't seem justified. I disagree and I think men just have major solipsism on this issue. Imagine your wife said to you, I trust you completely and I know you would never cheat, but I've read some stories about women whose husbands cheated for years without them knowing. So for my own peace of mind I need the passwords to all your accounts and I need to read your texts every day. Just to be sure. Are you telling me you wouldn't feel insulted by this, and like she doesn't trust you as much as she claimed? Even if you ultimately gave in to her request, you wouldn't feel the tiniest pang of hurt and anger that she asked in the first place? You can do it before the wife has had the baby? How? No, not before she's had the baby. Why would you need to do it before?

I'm not being *disloyal* by owning other coins, any more than, say, pretending that the 1MB was always intended by Satoshi as part of his original vision and that anything *other* than 1MB is an alt. I own 2240 ETH. Does that make me a pumper, in your eyes?? If it does, then, seriously, what does that mean? That you think Bitcoin should develop unchallenged, that it is all but assumed that Bitcoin will be the #1 coin? I'm picking investments based on these criteria( and am I wrong? I own ETH, FACTOM, and maybe 30 other coins (BTC is by far my largest investment, and I have ~60 BTC), mainly because, for me, having a stake in something really helps keep me motivated to try and stay on top of this space. How do you view this? Am I apostate in some way?? Also, small aside: Can I ask you a direct question? Since we're educating me (and don't mean that sarcastically), here, do I even understand the future of Bitcoin, correctly, at least, in terms of how you envision it? You have a way, way better handle on the roadmap's implications than I do. **Will Bitcoin become a settlement layer? Or will it somehow, one day, become freedom cash that disintermediates the existing, legacy financial system?** I don't want to bloat your day wasting time on this if you have already posted this somewhere, but, as you can imagine, following all this is a full time job. Do you have a link I can read to better understand this? Thank you again for engaging, Greg.\n",

Now OFC, I dont think thats right, and i dont think any fair minded person would think thats right. I think you should submit a complaint. The organisation you went through need to and deserve to kow what kind of farmer they are dealign with, for all you know the other people before you have submitted complaints too, and if you're the first person to apprentice with that farmer, then they have even more need to know what she is like. I think the way she approached you is wrong, and the way she spoke to you is definitely wrong, but take this as a learnign experience. Most apprenticeships expect you to push yourself extremely hard at least thats what I've found. It sorts the good willing workers form the not so willing (not saying you arent willing) So take a big breath and sigh in relief that you aren't working with that woman any mroe, and go to the next apprenticeship with a fuck yeah attitude and knock their socks off. Ask as many questions as you need to, all and any, even if you think theyre stupid. there is no such thing as a stupid question when you need to know how to do something. And get in plain and simple terms what is expected of you, if she expected to do those baking dishes even with your free time, thats what she expected. its a raw deal, but its what she expected. In the apprenticeships i did, which were unpaid, I worked 12 hour days 5 days a week. It was a tough slog and I bearly got time to sit. Just how it was, and to work there I had to do it.

Jung's aim was to explain common behaviors of extraversion; the enthusiasm, talkativeness, sociability, need for stimulation, need to spend time with others and boredom of being alone. If you are an Extroverted Intuitive type then you should also fit this description at least to a higher degree than Introversion. If you are not social and you can be described by Ne better than Ti, then something is wrong, whether that's your self understanding, the theory, or your definitions I don't know. Your function stack shows you what functions are best suited for you It's more about dominant functions suppressing opposing attitudes. Again, Jung was set out to explain things that already exist, you can try to use his theory to make assertions about reality but I think it proves highly ineffective. You know my type, right? ENTJ.

I dont suffer from anxiety, but clutter really puts me on edge. It's not on purpose. I see things in steps and can often combine two or three together. I have many times called my process 'controlled chaos'. It looks like clutter from the outside but I know the exact order everything (should) be in. Also, if were both upset, trying to debate out the problem right away. I need time to calm down and think about why Im upset or think of how to best vocalize it. He will press and press until I say anything and then hell try and argue a solution The way I see it is: If our natural state is calm and happy and we're upset then it needs to be 'fixed'. Like the steps I mentioned above, even when we're arguing/debating/talking about one thing, I'm also thinking about the problem and how we got into the situation. Was it my fault? Maybe it was a circumstance of the situation? Bad day? I need to know. Information is power and the only way I'm going to move forward is by talking it out... when Ive only worked out a fifth of my feelings.

      "What is interesting is that I want a relationship that is exactly the opposite. I try to include my partners in my mental escapades and that is a bad idea. They end up either annoyed or overwhelmed. I don't think, however, having sex all summer is a waste of time. Do you think you're going to give your relationship up to focus on yourself? I was at a point your girlfriend was at once. My boyfriend poured all of his time into me. Part of this was of course because of the honeymoon phase and his obsession with me but another part of it was because I was really depressed and required a lot of attention. It drained him over time. When I started getting better, I got more into my reading and writing again but now he doesn't really care to keep up with me. When I'm at an intellectual peak, my relationships fail. I end up having to pick one or the other. For once, I would like to not have to do that. It would be nice to date someone I can read and write with who can keep up with me or at least has a desire to want to do that. And I don't read particularly easy things: I mainly read wikipedia, math textbooks, philosophy books, books on biochemistry, pharmacology and organic chemistry. I will pick up an LSAT or MCAT guide just to study for tests I have no desire to take because I don't really want to be a doctor or a lawyer but I want to know *how* to be one. I despise fiction and can't watch tv for long which is something my partners also like to do. I end up dating people who tend to mainly want to play video games. That lack of intellectual stimulation is painful for me. Sucks to suck. Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she will understand. I love my relationship but if I had to sacrifice my brain for it, I would be miserable. Right now I'm sort of in that predicament being a grad student in Math and in a long distance relationship. On top of that, I read, write and listen to music. I'm able to balance all of it but my partner can't seem to and I'm not entirely sure what he does outside of go to work and play games at home. He's starting school soon so I imagine we're probably going to break up or something. Now I'm rambling. Agh, anyway. You should talk to her. Maybe tell her you want to spend more time reading.

      "I was a transfer student at this neighborhood secondary school. Not a great school, a lot of discipline problems and trouble kids. I wasn't in the worst class so I silently hoped I just have no problems and have peace and quiet. My first day of school was alright. I made some friends with the girl's clique and I kept to myself. There was only 1 other Chinese dude in the class and we are both tall so we sat behind. After my first day of school ends, the teacher left the class, and the class bully/trouble kid went to the Chinese dude to kacau him. In fits of anger, the Chinese dude flipped the table as a sign of protest. ) I was really alerted. The bully got mad and then grabbed the nearest wooden chair and smashed it on the Chinese dude's back. He screamed in agony, his face was bleeding and I just sat there dumbfounded. My new girl friends were like 'shh bb it's ok it's normal around here'. All I could think was 'great I'm in gangster school'. Chinese dude's parents filed a police report etc. Later that week I found out he wasn't the greatest of lad to begin with. He would stare at my boobs and find excuses to go home with me when I just wanted to make friends. I stayed away from him as much as I could. The bully dude actually turned out to treat me nicer than I expected (except always calling me 'moi!') and he once told me he kind of thought he was heroic for 'punishing' the Chinese dude cuz he can't stand him.

As I did them I also looked for better situations and opportunities and went to those as soon as I could. The trick to working in less than ideal jobs, is finding and paying attention to the things in it that are enjoyable and satisfying for than the things that are awful about it. Another thing is to recall that this is temporary and you are actively working towards something more enlivening for yourself. A solid plan and timeline helps with this. Also there are no absolutes.

      "Just a few more questions for you: 1.\tYou argue that most emotional trauma is due to stresses of life. True, but the argument I used previously was that negative emotions will still occur with things like the death of loved ones, whether from old age or unfortunate accidents (which itd be difficult to argue could be totally prevented even in a utopia). Are you planning to put everyone on drugs all the time just in case something bad happens? Because it doesnt sound totally feasible, as Ill explain below. 2.\tThere are neurobiological problems with assuming you can design a type of medicine that can specifically affect certain emotions, as well as the generally accepted fact that all drugs have a side effect, which might make people not want to be on them all the time. But apart from that Im having trouble wrapping my head around what exactly you would define as a negative emotion and how that would be quantified (and by whom). Sure, we can say fear is negative in a LOT of contexts (particularly in the modern world where we dont often have to defend ourselves from predators). But what about the fear that rushes through you when, say, your kid is leaning off the balcony on the second story and is about to fall off? That negative emotion allows adrenaline to rush to the brain so we can quickly grab the kid. Without feeling that fear, our reaction time would almost definitely decrease, and theres a chance the kid dies. Which I guess we wouldnt care so much about, seeing as we cant feel any sadness about it. And then what about an emotion like nostalgia? That's similar to both sadness and happiness. Do we take away our ability to feel bittersweet memories of things that have passed? Would that improve our lives or make them emptier? 3.\tNot trying to draw a conclusion that you didnt make, but right now your argument goes from People commit crimes due extreme stresses or mental illness (which I agree with), then flows into, technology can fix the violent and reactive Feelers. I think you are deeply misunderstanding the way functions work if you believe that Feelers are the only ones who react negatively to stress. In fact you should read up on the grip/inferior functions( and what that means for Thinkers in particular. As an INFP when I am super stressed I actually shove my main functions aside and lean heavily on my Te, which means I suddenly have high standards for organizing my life and start being extremely disciplined about things. If Im in a group atmosphere, I might even step to the front and take charge. Often this means I am actually unable to openly emotionally react to really shocking situations. Whereas Thinkers might actually be more emotionally reactive in that way because their Feeling function suddenly comes out in full force. Overall, ALL types can feel stress and can reach the breaking point that it takes to get to in order to commit crimes. We would not just be fixing Feelers as they are not the only ones who feel negative emotions. And besides that, as I've already said, I don't see the distinction between negative and positive emotions as clearly as you do.\n",

      "but pope Francis and other figures in the Catholic church definitely condemn anything outside the gender norms as unnatural. I follow norms fine, so there shouldn't be an issue here. but ultimately the treatment at best seems near identical to Catholic treatment and positions towards homosexuality, where actual rights (marriage, sexuality, education, etc and in our case medical transition) are seen as extremely sinful. Except.... there's nothing in the bible like that. I can see where the being gay is a sin thing comes from. But there's nothing like that for trans, hence the question. Just seems odd to just jut out and randomly pick a position that's technically against the bible. It threw my dad on a curveball for sure, he had to search up (dunno, maybe he asked a priest or something) how to respond (well his immediate opinion was that it was stupid shit but ultimately he's the kind of Catholic who had to look up exactly how to respond). Hmm... Yeah that sounds likely. Just asked someone, they probably just went with their gut (and the countless misconceptions about trans people), which was the net result. As for if Catholics themselves are accepting of the trans community, while it varies I would say from my experiences that anyone with the more religious mindset probably doesn't accept us at all. Indeed. But then again, I find most religious people don't really know what's in their book. I actually know quite a lot of devoutly religious people who are entirely cool with trans people. Provided, of course, you aren't gay, don't crossdress, and follow gender norms.\n",

      "Yeah, fair enough. Frankly, it's her job to say she doesn't want it if she doesn't want it- because who the heck can read minds- but it's also a good idea for the guy to stop if he *does* happen to notice that she is freezing up and not participating. Chances are, she's not enjoying it if that's happening. Sadly, though, as you're likely painfully aware, this sort of thing is nuanced and it can sometimes appear that your partner is into it when she's not- and that's not your fault at all when it does happen. It's not anybody's job to play psychologist with a sex partner who is supposed to be a mature adult. As for accusations of rape, well, only an absolute *monster* would falsely accuse someone of rape and ruin their life. But there are likely a lot of people out there who consent to sex when they don't want it and end up feeling used because they aren't mature/self aware enough to understand the complexity of their own emotions, that that's where it gets grey. Admittedly, I've never been involved in anything like these scenarios (never had a one night stand or even casually dated anyone) but I do hear about it a lot from friends (of both genders) and it seems that a good rule of thumb might be that you should get to know somebody before having sex with them. This won't likely be a popular opinion, but... Maybe meet them in person something like 5ish times before going all the way with them so that you can get a sense of how mature they are/whether or not they're on the same page as you- because, frankly, immaturity and sex do *not* mix that well. People get high on all sorts of chemicals and emotions run high. It takes a mature person to understand what those chemicals mean. Maybe the type of person everyone should want to have sex with is one who is so enthusiastic about sleeping with you that he/she can wait a couple more weeks before sealing the deal. If a prospective sex partner only offers up a narrow, easily missable window of opportunity for sex, they're probably not half as into it as they ought to be.\n",

      " But there's also a chance that every single ball goes left every single time (if it's truly random -- say a quantum quincunx. So the outcome might happen to not look like a normal distribution: all the balls might end up on the left. So, no, it's not entirely predictable; deterministic also means perfectly predictable, so that word is out too. This can only happen in the limited perspective. But if you look at the whole multiverse, all of it, right now, which is represented by one row of Pascal's triangle (somewhere way, way, way down from the beginning of things), this doesn't happen. If all possible things that can happen do happen (which is a common concept in particle physics), then ALL of the possible ways that the wave function can collapse happen, for some observer, somewhere, somewhen. So, we get the theory of the multiverse, where each time a wave function collapses a new timeline/univese is formed. From within one of those time lines/universes, things look highly unpredictable, but since they all happen, on the larger scale of the whole of reality, things are entirely predictable. Thus the randomness is also deterministic. Now, the multiverse theory is not super popular right now, but it's definitely quite reasonable, and certainly makes more sense than a single universe where stuff just happens for no reason, and is just arbitrarily the way it is. (Or the way it is because of some programmer/god, though that just adds another level of universe on top of ours, so that seems sort of pointless to go that way.)\n",

I did like the influence system, although it was a bit rough around the edges. An updated version of that would be nice. My only problem with influence system was that it wasn't properly balanced. Some characters have plenty of dialogue and you really get to know more about them while gaining influence (Kreia, Handmaiden), but some just stay silent for the most of the game (Bao-Dur). Also, because you squadmates join you at different time based on the order of planets you visit. It was difficult to gain enough influence with characters you met too late.

      "Eh... I like to have my mind blown. I love something that makes me connect, speculate, go beyond one linear level. I want to puzzle, to think, to *wonder.* The sci-fi themes are pretty nice, but they are action movies, which are really not my thing. And that this world painted in the movie is a gross one devoid of safety, creature comforts, reliability, and scientific accuracy with the whole people-for-power thing, and is instead full of danger, action, hard work to survive, the almost biblical trope of the chosen one junk being pushed constantly...it's not for me. If I ever found out I was in the Matrix, and taken out of it, because I would have trouble turning down a *know secret stuff* option, I just wouldn't care to live outside and fight to end it. I would instead barter to go back in and not expose the secret in exchange for superpower cheat codes. Also, I'm not big on that grimy, cyberpunk style. At least not now. It's definitely cultural. In the wake of the economic fall and technological rise over the 00s, there has been a shift to look ahead and hope; the future could be bright, colorful, fun, full of wonder and freedom and convenience. We're at the other end of that cycle currently. On the other end, in the comfortable stability of the 90s and early 00s, it was fascinating to imagine enduring some hardship, a world where things were harsher, and being badass through it. This spawned the landmark pieces like The Matrix and Fight Club, and the long-running Star Trek franchise's sharp turn into hard, corrupt, wartorn, cyberpunk in Deep Space 9. For a succinct example of this shift, compare the aesthetic of Fallout 3 to Fallout 4. Or hell, even the rebooted Star Trek's shift from the whites and light greys of the Apple-y 2008-2012 to a bold, vivid, colorful feel just look at the posters. Tangent, sorry, I've been theorizing on the subject lately. Anyway, something that might be more apt besides other shows like The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror which is more bizarre idea exposure to be eagerly consumed for further speculation is ARGs. I love the idea, the creativity involved. It's digging into these intricate tunnel networks of another's winding personal reasoning. I love jumping into others' understandings, new perspectives. Patterns and codes and puzzles everywhere. I have also learned I hate participating in such a thing because of the infinite ways of interpretation for a clue, and I suck at it.

      " Self-driving buses will eliminate some of the human barriers to increasing mass transportation service to where it's both cheaper and nicer than what we have now. Most of the cost of those buses come from fuel, maintenance, and the bus itself not the driver. Larger vehicles are harder to automate, because they can't just stop instantly. They have to anticipate and start slowing down early, especially in bad weather, and no AI is even close to doing that. Small feeder vehicles that handle the last mile problem of mass transportation, at low speeds (15 mph like google's small vehicles do now), seems more plausible. Insurance premium incentives for getting a self driving car (or at least abandoning your manually driven car) might also push things a bit faster. With an up-front cost of $10k by 2025 for self-driving tech, it would take over a decade to pay for itself, and that's assuming self-driving cars would need no insurance whatsoever which is unlikely.

The Broncos will be looking at a QB either at 5 or earlier. Then you have the Bills and Cardinals who need a long term QB who could trade up as well. The only wildcard I see is the Browns, who could either stay at 4 and take the BPA or trade down. Either way I've got a feeling that Barkley will fall to 6, their GM hasn't valued RB's highly in the past (Highest selected RB was Kareem Hunt in the 3rd round). Plus the Browns have signed Hyde in FA, so it's definitely possible that he could fall to us.\n",

Mister Scott, for the fourth time, you are not on trial for murder here. No one has suggested that you killed anyone. Please just answer the question vis-a-vis your contact with the person standing trial here, and we will let you get back to your family as soon as possible. OK look, I don't actually have a family like I told you I did, Michael replied. Except for my work family, I guess. And you know what? Those people would never, _ever_ kill someone, the way you think this uh...this warehouse guy did. That guy was practically a temp! OBJECTION! Dwight shot up from his seat in the front row of the audience. The witness is _lying_ through his teeth. One of his employees did commit murder in the past, your honor. Mister Scott is lying to cover up a homicide committed by Jim Halpert. The judge's mouth dropped open a bit. She cocked her head to the side and squinted at Dwight. Your honor, that's just a disgruntled employee, your honor. You can ignore him, Michael said. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Jim was cleared of all charges. In the audience, and on the opposite side of the courtroom from Dwight, Jim Halpert looked up and turned bright red. He looked around to his fellow employees for sympathy, or even a simple explanation. But none of of them seemed interested in making eye contact with anyone but the judge, who was clearly growing more irritated by the second. OK, look. Michael? Answer. The. Question. We need to move on. Judge Lopez scribbled some notes on a paper and slid it to the side. Dwight, still standing, frowned and jerked his head back. Your honor, did you just call the witness 'Michael'? Do you--do you _know_ the witness personally? There was a long pause. Michael stared at the floor, suddenly deep in thought. Oh...f***, he muttered under his breath. For the last half hour, he had been trying to suppress his memories of his fiery but short-lived relationship with the Judge Lopez. Now he began to cringe as he saw visions of each and every one of those memories receiving public scrutiny. Directly across from Michael, Kevin looked over at Phyllis and the two grinned.

It makes a delicious cake. A cake you refused to even acknowledge, when I just wanted you to taste a piece of it, and tell me how it tasted to you. It's not that it's obvious. I don't think it is. It's more you totally missed it when it's literally all along my discourse. I find that a tad insulting. only if i was given a reason. A logical reason It's data you potentially don't have If it's bullshit, you'll risk nothing with your laser sharp logic. Potential worth, and no risk, it sounds quite like a good deal to me. What do you think can you reasonably show that non-reason is needed? Sadly, not without making a self demonstration. I already tried that a couple of times here. Logical bombs, explication of ethics, the why I'm right because I'm an idiot, and why you're wrong because you're Spock diatribe. You really need to be willing to try the demonstration of it by yourself. It's the demonstration by the absurd that logic is sometimes shit I was trying to pull up. It's a shame you can't recognize such basic correct logical reasoning. that sounds a bit unreasonable ... I think it is. Maybe it's the key to unlock the impossible.

      "Lies about the constitution (citation needed) to claim otherwise, in any way alarmist/trolling sensationalist phrasing is fun especially when it is in loose support of ignoring information that contradicts your flawed understanding of events. ... Where to start. You can't have a theocratic republic. So saying a person is for the constitution (founding document of this Constitional republic,) and for theocracy is contradictory by definition. You are purposely or not misreading events and statements in a way consistent with how the mainstream media has attempted to manipulate public perception rather than anything actually based in what Ron Paul has said. Why can I say this so strongly? Because he has explicitly characterized his positions. IE they are all down on the record, you simply haven't taken the time or effort to look them up, you misread a policy position and thought it meant something it didn't because you didn't understand where he was coming from when he made that judgement. Ron Paul would like the states to go back to being a counterweight to imperial federal power (A key part of the founders conception of checks and balances on government power,) this would involve allowing them to cultivate their own characters which best reflected the people that made up that area, which should allow them to try and perhaps fail by their own actions and accounting. Ron Paul has explicitly stated that he believes _it is theoretically self defeating and impossible to attempt to legislate morality._ This simple position is completely in the face of your blabbery about him wanting a theocracy. If you knew ANYTHING about his ideology you would understand that he view liberty as a primary end and sees theocracy as a direct threat to liberty, just like any other totalitarian governmental arrangement, all things he would resist. Super quick breakdown: The more artificial restrictions you place on an agent's behavior, be they a nation, state or individual the more you limit the viable strategies which could and would otherwise arise. The further you pull the balance of agent's behavior away from where it would otherwise reach equilibrium with artificial restrictions or rigidities the more value that could have been otherwise created if those resources were not allocated artificially. Read Ron Paul's economics then you can start to understand the modus operandi that drives his decision making.\n",

Can they walk into a bar and get sex on command? No. But IMO that's a pretty unreasonable standard to go by.\n",

The fact that this is the treatment prescribed, and the fact that individual finds it the best course of action to deal with their depression...I'm obviously not qualified to make such a call, but it has always occurred to me that forcing them to get out of bed, socialise, work, busy their minds, etc. could sometimes be much more effective than allowing their thoughts to perpetuate themselves...\n",

      "white male privilege tends to have to do with the stuff white males don't have to worry about on a day to day basis. like with females, it's normal for a girl to worry about how specifically appropriate their attire is for where they will be spending their time in case of unwanted attention that can lead to more dangerous situations. also, they worry about their drinks getting drugged at bars and have to deal with unwanted groping. there are things tied into different races as well. as an asian american i tend to be automatically assumed to be intelligent but not free thinking/creative/charismatic or not similar enough to white americans to build a compatible working relationship with. this image of me exists in many people's mind from the moment they see me before i get to open my mouth. so i have to take the extra effort to dispel these assumptions. ivy league colleges specifically stopped taking in top scores as their main qualifier because asians tend to have high grades and they don't want a large percentage of asians in their college. even top music schools stopped giving scholarships to or stopped accepting in students who master piano or violin because they are deemed as asian instruments. there is also a class thing when it comes to blacks. since the system was stacked against blacks for so many years due to racism, it becomes hard to escape poor culture. when one grows up in a poor neighborhood around poor people who don't even believe it's possible to live a better life outside of poverty, it is difficult to grow into an adult who can do so or raise your own child to do so. it is said by some successful blacks who escaped such a life that the best cure for black poverty isn't to give them money but to take them (kids) out into the city, show them the world and of the possible future they can live outside of their neighborhood. these are only small examples. there are many many more and they stack up. things that make it hard to move and live in different areas, things that make it difficult to keep a job, even to share opinions. things that increase jail time, things that makes certain people more likely to be found guilty of a crime. things that make it difficult to vote even as a citizen, etc etc etc. being non male and non white comes with lots of disadvantages, most of it effects people mentally, some of it is ingrained in a system. when being white is considered the normal and being a man frees you from the disadvantages of low pay and a subtle but constant worry of physical assault or rape, it becomes a distinct advantage to be a white male in the US. the privilege comes from not having to deal with any of that stuff. you can focus and worry more about the other problems in life while everyone one else have those same problems compounded onto these other things that exists specifically due to their sex and race. and i know there are times when whites are disliked for their being white and men are disliked for them being men but pointing that out is much like a christian in the US complaining about people discriminating against them for being christian. they haven't had to deal with what it's like being discriminated for being muslim or sikh or any other smaller religion.\n",

No arguments approaching coherent justification exist. And what's more, even Catholics know this. They don't think their bad natural law arguments are good. They think that they at least are an argument, and they just need one to arrive at the desired conclusion they believe for other reasons. Problem is catholicism itself doesn't have enough legitimacy to present it thinking something as a real reason to take it seriously morally.

      "I am an INTP that has deep feelings. Whatever I do (say, learn A.I.) is done for feelings (because it is so fascinating!). I am moved to tears by music. I enjoy to watch paintings a lot. When I am with my SO, we are all feels, happy in our little bubble. But at the same time I like to analyze, find errors in arguments and construct a coherent system that explains everything I know. I am very good with technical stuff. I like to solve problems and design complex systems. I don't know what I am: an INTP, an INFP or INFJ. I tested out as all of these. My theory is that depending on the situation, certain personality traits become active or passive. So, in one situation I might be emotional while in another I might be cerebral (T/F), in one situation I am carefree and desire exploration, while in another I am conscientious and desire efficiency (P/J). For example, what do you call a person who likes to chill, enjoy life on a day to day basis and doesn't want to feel constrained by have to do this or that. But, because he knows he is like this, he is also careful in the important moments in life, when choosing a career, when picking a job, when managing money and when taking a house loan. It seems to me like J is present here, making sure to create a safe-zone for P to exist in. To be conscientious in order to be more free to dream and explore. Is this P or J?\n",

I've explained my logical case, you've made a case riddled with flaws and assumptions rooted in sentiment. I understand the distinction you make between positive and negative rights. I just think the distinction is meaningless. I guess I will repeat what I said before, since it applies here. Thats something very basic and you are failing to grasp it in a stupid way. Its pretty clear you are not able or willing to grasp a very basic distinction. So its pointless. Negative and positive rights are rights that respectively oblige either action (positive rights) or inaction (negative rights). Thats based on common understanding, which has no bearing on whats true. I could say I have the right to sleep on your property without you taking any action against me. You could, but you would be wrong. You don't have a right not to be prevented from violating someone else's liberty, like you don't have the negative right not to be prevented from raping me.\n",

If you've never played a VN before it might be a bit intimidating at the beginning but it will be worth it and you will get hooked. It's a time commitment, but not so much that you'll be spending months of your life or anything. It's easily manageable. I HIGHLY recommend reading the VN first (and if you're interested, PM me and I'll help you set it up). If for some reason you absolutely hate the idea of visual novels or whatever, I'd recommend just watching the currently airing Fate/stay night: unlimited blade works adaptation by ufotable and then watching the heavens feel movies when they come out. You'll be missing out on the Fate route though, and a lot of details from UBW and HF. After that watch Fate/Zero. If you don't mind being spoiled major reveals from Heavens Feel, you can watch Fate/Zero first. Again, I highly highly recommend reading the VN then watching fate zero (and starting the currently airing once you finish that route). The VN was intended to be read before watching Fate/zero.\n",

I think this has become more obvious now that I live alone. What I mean by that is I've gotten very bad at keeping apartment clean, doing laundry, etc. whereas when I lived with others it was easier to carry out these tasks because I can get on the other's wavelength. Same thing with homework. Around others working it's easier to get started but on my own I just sink into my own little world. I'm still working on fixing this. Have to envision myself feeling better after it's all done. Sometimes it just gets so bad to the point where I have to carry out said tasks. 3 meals a day is hard too (though frankly this is starting to sound like what a lot of people experience when in college; nothing crazy). Feel need to withdraw when I'm around people for TOO long or if the people I'm around wear me out because of how intense they are.

      "Faith is shaky and making large, universal assumptions on the foundation of something so uncertain doesn't fly with a lot of people. Especially since we're supposedly living in the age of reason now. Also, if there were proof of a celestial dictator, it would make selling literal and figurative snake oil so much easier. Basically in the same way Jehovah's wittinesses love to cite scientific literature out of context to demonstrate that creationism is viable. Religious faith is irrational and comes with a shit ton of presuppositions. Their argument is that if you can prove the existence of God, their religious practices and moral codes would be vindicated, albeit this isn't necessarily true. IMHO there isn't a single good argument for the existence of God thst isn't either pure logical masturbation or emotional non-sense. Theologians and philosophers have been at it for millenia and so far, the results have been disappointing.\n",

They just need more time to process the information I guess. Ni means introverted intuition. In a nutshell, Ni is quite similar to Si, except they take in less and think through what they take in more. If you find yourself going zen mode, like thinking about deeper meanings of this universe and other deep stuff, you might be an INFJ. In other words, ISFJs can remember events and facts better.

Then I wake up this morning to my roommate putting up a vinyl accordion door she bought to separate our cats... I moved in with friends a month and a half ago. I have one cat and they have two. Mine and the elder of theirs were doing just fine for weeks, and then started fighting recently, so we're trying to go back to the original set-up of keeping the cats separated when we're not around to supervise. Problem with that is, my cat is both incredibly intelligent and incredibly athletic. Since being allowed the run of the apartment, she has decided she does not like being cordoned off into my hallway of it, and has learned that she can jump the pet gate we were originally using to separate/acclimate the cats. Roommate puts up vinyl door this morning instant fail. She's upset and concerned about her cat getting hurt (hers is bigger, mine is much, *much* faster) and wants this problem solved or my cat confined to my bathroom *now*. So I come up with an idea to keep the door closed, chug some coffee, and go buy hardware to implement it. Spend an hour implementing. Cat *immediately* gets out (by forcing the thing to give enough that she could slither out the gap it created between the door and the wall). Okay, fine, I can make it better. Make it better. Cat gets out. Fix that failure point. Repeat for two hours. Cat runs out of ways to get *past* the vinyl door, and starts to work on *disassembling* it by ripping the thinner bit out of its frame. I say fuck that idea entirely, and go spend thirty bucks on corrugated plastic to line and vertically extend the original pet gate. Five hours later, I finally have it in a configuration that she can neither jump/climb over nor create a significant gap in through which to wriggle through the plastic and then jump/climb over the wire gate. She is frustrated and unhappy, I am frustrated and unhappy, and now that I'm done eating, I've got to stop feeling sorry for myself and see how much work I can get done before I can't keep my eyes open tonight. The answer is definitely not enough. And when I get home, I half-expect her to have learned how to work the carabiners that ultimately keep the now heavily-fortified pet gate closed, or otherwise managed to escape. It truly would not surprise me. This fucking cat has been known to use tools. (I love my cat. I love her *so much*. But she is causing me such a headache right now.)\n",

      "Dear TheBirdsareaGoodIdea, I'm sorry you've met some of my extreme counterparts who have led you to feel wronged. The point of social justice is to make the community better and more aware, not to hurt it and definitely not to hurt individuals to the point where they feel like their spirit has been broken. The issues of privilege, patriarchy and colonization are complicated and extensive. When people say they hate white people, men, or whatever, they are talking about hating the oppressive institution as a whole. Not the individual itself. Privilege specifically refers to conforming (involuntarily, usually) with what society thinks is correct, e.g. white, male, cis-gendered, heterosexual, able bodied, middle/upper-middle class. It means that people with those privileges have it easier. Most people, if not everyone, have some sort of privilege. The whole discussion about privilege is to make people aware of their individual privilege and realize that some people don't have that, and use that to help those are don't. It's not about making *you* feel bad or guilty, it's about dispelling ignorance and increasing awareness. That and having privilege means that you have more of an ability to change the system than someone who doesn't. For example, I'm a Hispanic, cis-gendered, heterosexual, light-skinned female. I might not have white privilege but I do have other kinds. Does it mean that I should feel bad about it or feel guilty? Not at all. It means that I have to be aware of it, understand it, and understand that some people have it harder socially because they don't. Please understand that we're not all angry, hateful people that want to hurt others or put them down. Your letter really concerns me and I'm really worried about your health. Please consider seeing a therapist and working on your self worth. You are worth so much and you seem like a really good person. If you weren't, you wouldn't take all this to heart like this. Don't worry about social justice for now if it's that overwhelming. Focus on yourself and learn to love yourself again and try to be the best person you can be. At the root of social justice is a desire to be good people, surrounded by other good people, living in a just and happy society. If you ever want to chat or vent, or whatever, I'm around. If I could I would give you the biggest hug right now. Please take care of yourself. Sincerely, Viviana A., An SRS member that doesn't hate you for being a white male, promise.

This is actually more typical of Ti, so you must be around some super mature ENFJs :) As mentioned elsewhere in replies, I firmly believe Fe is about understanding hurt-ness, but not pain. Fe reveals actions that lead to harm and sort of instinctively avoids them as 'just bad'. While it's my tert, I've found my processing to be not very accepting of pain I don't understand. Universally empathising with pain I would say is actually more Fi; showing understanding of it with sympathy and responding to the hurt I would say is where the Fe's extroverted directionality comes in to play.\n",

As a Feeler myself, it does feel innately wrong for me to say the phrase not everyone's opinion is equally valid. However I do agree that of course if one person is an expert in a subject (or at least relatively well-versed) and the other is unfamiliar with it you should step back and defer your opinion to the expert. But, I'm not sure deference is the same as feelings. I have to say that as both an introvert and a woman I probably defer my opinions in debates more often than I should, because I usually listen before speaking, which sometimes result in MY opinion not being considered equally valid by the other party. So that's probably a factor in this experiment as well--it's not always just a I want you to feel good thing, it's often a you seem like a stubborn asshole so I'm not even going to bother disagreeing thing. It's about picking your battles sometimes (maybe something else that ENTPs do less of than I do, haha)\n",

I brought up bodies in the box as an example of wingers getting in the box even when they don't have the ball, not that it's a sign of playing well. And ye penetration is still a problem, but it was a much better performance today in terms of creating chances which I'd attribute more to us having more forward thinking than Chelsea being shite. And most of the chances were from good buildup play. Mata's, Herrera's, and Rooney's opportunities were from generally good play (or at least, better than it's ever been this season for us). There was more attacking intent, and you can call them one-off opportunities, but it's definitely a positive and move away from the negative, pointless possession we've been playing in recent weeks. Obviously it's not as great as City's or Arsenal's or any top side atm, but it was good. Like I said, he was good at bringing other people into play and did come close to scoring a couple of times. Comparing him to Kun is pointless because obv he's not nearly as good, but in the context of today's game there were only a few who deserved it more than Rooney (Martial, De Gea, or Courtois).\n",

      "Im confused as to why yard work, breastfeeding, working, and deep cleaning the house is on you. Thats way too much responsibility. If you work too, chores need to be split up. You're getting a shitty deal. As far as the being rude about it, wow what an asshole. I always think you should try counseling which Im glad youre doing, but I would see what the therapist says (he/she will be on your side) and then bring up the unfair labor arrangement you have. In therapy, he needs to be told that he has to do his fair share of chores. He just fucked himself by complaining about the house so he can lay in the bed he made. As far as the comment about not spending time with your child, umm what a fucking dick. Someone HAS to do those things and you should also bring that up in therapy that he wants to deem you a bad mom, but isnt helping you either. That is another chore that can be split 50/50 so you can relax and spend time with the baby. He just fucked himself into another chore. edit: having been in therapy lots of years for myself, I wouldnt spend a lot of time on how it made you feel though you should definitely bring it up. Focus more on the solution which is getting him to do more chores. The feelings will resolve itself when you have more help in the house and he's on the hook for doing the chores also. I would say something like when you berated me for not deep cleaning the house and doing yard work instead, it made me upset because you are just as capable as me of helping with the chores since we both work. While we're discussing the state of the house, I think we should discuss how unfairly the expectations are placed on me to deep clean the house. Id like to come up with a more equitable split. This puts him at a disadvantage because then instead of discussing whether your reaction is fair or not (hurt feelings), you have to discuss what HE'S going to do instead of complaining. You could waste the whole hour talking about whether your feelings are justified, whether he meant to say it that way, whatever, but it doesnt solve your unfair chore split. Whether you stay or leave, doesnt really matter today which is getting treated fairly in your own fucking home. You can still leave him if hes mean like he is, but in the interim while youre working on your marriage, creating an exit plan, whatever, he can do his fucking share of the chores since its such a problem for him\n",

      "Actually Like S3 the most as an entertaining episodic show. Sure, the serious atmosphere is nice, but the weight they gave to the cartoon villains was just laughable. It's schlocky justice porn. I liked how S2 committed more to poetic justice, contextualizing the supporting cast, as well as committing to an arc where the Hell Girl services are easily abused. Mitsugane had no fucking idea that it would be made, so they had to find a way to bring Enma back, she's the token symbol of the show. But also they wanted to have more fun with the episodic bullshit, they embraced how cartoony the villains are so there is less restraint on how bad they are, driving their victims into a similar insanity instead. So their grudge of revenge just plunges them deeper into despair instead of just having to cope with the same daily life, but with their soul cursed. *That* is why I see Mitsugane as a better episodic show. The stringed plotline is admittedly so much weaker that I wanted to punch the monitor after the end of the season. The twist was just icing on a very bland cake already, there was no reason to sympathize for an illusion when it doesn't make any sense at all. It's a half hearted attempt of a gut punch with no real build up aside: she must become the next Hell Girl! Why her when she obviously doesn't have the soul for it? S4 is basically 6 more episodes of the show, the other 6 are selected episode remakes of S1&2. Some are good some are bad, wish they'd learn from S3 that they can be entertaining and more poignant as a consequence, but I guess I'm in the minority believing that.\n",

      "What do you consider yourself in a religious sense Discordian. Yes, really. Are you Gnostic or Agnostic Gnostic. What are the reasons for you being (A discordian) I'm a being of chaos to put is as simply as I can. I believe more in a kind of balance more than a real concept of god. And I like to change my swears about god with the name of a goddess. Either Eris or Celestia, if the latter can be considered as such. Is religion important to you: Not that much. My stance is more about mocking people totally rigid and invested in their religious belief than being practicing or even really religious myself. Something something gold apple, worm, if you will. Have you ever changed your belief in your life: I used to be vaguely agnostic. I don't see passing on the gnostic side as a huge change of stance, so I think my answer is no. I like joking saying I was a discordian before knowing about discordianism, because it's technically true. Have you ever argued for your religion or against: My religious choices are mostly meant so I can argue against both of the main sides, with the real advantage of not being of bad faith at any moment. As you said it quite crudely, OP, it would have been a waste of Ne to not do so as an ENTP. If you do argue what arguments to you tend to stick too My argument are mostly based on the Socratic method. The more logical and consistency seeking my opponent is, the hardest they have with my arguments. I build ethic based arguments with logic. It makes things that sound really demented/paradoxical, when a simple mindset shift makes things bearable again. But my hugely negative karma breakdown is enough proof for anybody that I'm not as successful as I wished. How do you feel about religion I'm openminded, mostly. I like easten religions. I find the weastern ones I know a bit close-minded. The concept of dogma give me chills just saying it's name. It's too rigid and blind to me to be anywhere form acceptable. In day to day, I'm on live and let live. I seldom launch a religious debate by myself. I need to read the sacred writings/books before I can formulate good arguments. I just end up debating a bit too Euphoric atheists.\n",

This is very good feedback, thank you. It dovetails with my natural strengths to the degree that people constantly bug me about doing it, and I visualize myself doing it almost constantly, but there is definitely also a huge element to it that is not a good fit, and I'm currently trying to determine how to reduce the need for that element, adjust myself to it, do some mix of both, or reduce overall the deliverable quality to a degree that my need to do this thing is met in a way that isn't so difficult (my current stage--not too bad overall but still needs more time to see).

      "You should probably not spout unpopular opinions that you don't have vested interest in then; It was a passing comment. It's not like I'm preaching or anything. however I would love to hear more of your good reasons for touching children in a sexual way. Basically it comes down to a couple of issues: Minors' rights (which I'm fully supportive of), the fact that sexual maturity varies between individuals (the earliest ages being like 12-13), and what consent actually means (IMO if the person understands what they are doing and intends it, they consent). It becomes a more obvious position when you consider that most people who fall under the 'pedophile' label are maybe 18 or 19 and hooking up with 16 and 17 year olds. Obviously when you increase the age gap, it gets more disgusting, but so does sexual contact between adults. I mean, look at someone who just turned 18 hooking up with a 50 year old. Disgusting. Rewind their age one day to 17yo+364 days and it's suddenly taboo? That's nonsensical to me. Likewise, relations like 18+15 were perfectly 'okay' when it was 17+14. And is still seen as taboo when it's 20+17. It just doesn't make much sense to me. Honestly, the only time I really see possible issues (due to a lack of understanding, and thus unable to consent) is below the age of like 8. And that's just for sexual contact. The reasons to not outlaw viewing/downloading CP are even stronger. If you want me to go more in detail, please PM me. I realize this is a touchy topic, and I don't really care to spend the next while replying to everyone who has a automatic repulsion to it when they don't really have a rational reason. Keep in mind, I'm not saying it isn't disgusting. it is. I'm saying there's no technical issues with it. Which there isn't.\n",

      "part 2 of 2 with all the advice encouraging women to suck up abusive relationships ive told you already that i have helped several users and encouraged them to get out of bad situations if you wish to talk to hhl about her comments then do so people have a tendency to exaggerate and sensationalize women particularly want empathy and to be told youre right when theres a problem we have had users flat out lie try to hide important details and ultimately fessup to some really significant mistakes part of the process is figuring out as best we can a is this user being honest b is this user sharing all the important details c is this user being consistent its a process because the person is a stranger we dont know their agenda could be a troll or someone with an agenda could be a sincere user people rarely share the full story sure they share what the other person has done wrong and im not talking about physical violence here im talking about remarks forgotten tasks normal relationship stuff so a guy goes out to a bar instead of taking his gf to dinner hes a jerk the woman would have us believe then after a fashion it comes to light that the woman has been belittling badmouthing and ignoring her so throughout the week the guy has finally exhausted his patience and decides to go hang out with some friends at a bar the woman is ticked because they were supposed to go out to a nice dinner instead of telling the woman that yes your man is a jerk we say you treated him really poorly for an extended timeperiod and he wanted to get away from you if you want things to change you have to recognize your role in this situation we also tell women to find a good man the basic assumption on the rpw sub is that you are with a good and decent man if thats not the case and we pick up on it then yes we tell the woman to leave if you are with a good man and having problems then you have to focus on what you can change which begins and ends with yourself edit women ask for advice because they want to fix and improve their relationship just because a problem exists doesnt mean the woman should instantly throw in the towel and dissolve the bond the women that come to the rpw sub arent looking to have people say run away if theres a chance things can get better on another note at the end of the day its advice its advice from an online forum made up of strangers if someones personal judgement is so nonexistent that they will do whatever anyone on the internet tells them to do because they cant think for themselves and they dont know better then my guess is that person has a lot of issues that go way beyond anything people online can help them with are there instances where a woman should leave the relationship yes and when i see those situations i tell them they should leave but both philosophies hinge on the hatred and suppression of an entire group according to superficial pseudoscientific generalizations which causes real tangible harm to innocent people so you assume that every rp male user is by default evil what suppression what violence where are the murders and the protests happening on the street that demand women be enslaved people say nonsensical stupid stuff all the time and if your agenda is to topple trp over then do what you want but stop telling me that my views are evil when you dont even know what they are you know what else has been really evil the church and religion so are all christians evil because of the inquisition and the crusades americans are evil because there are bigots and racists within the country everyone that has a diamond can be considered evil for perpetuating violence and controversy you talk as though you arent in some way associated with tied to or influenced by people groups nations that have done bad things i think your focus and assertion that trp is somehow a great world evil is a bit ridiculous i see that you wrote another long comment about trp marks the end of humanity and the death of sunshine and flowers clearly this is a thing for you something that drives you and that youre passionate about great do what you want i am sorry if that offends you but if you choose to be a part of trp thats the cross you have to bear most people see trp as a hate group with pretty good reason imo and you will therefore receive criticism for it you either need to suck it up or avoid debate forums like this one im not gonna be gentle about this im not offended i just see this as pointless overblown hype and nonsense i have no cross to bear im not a victim im not hateful i seek to help people where and when i can all i really want is for bp users to get off their high horses and stay out of the rpw sub i am not sure how this is relevant you said i insulted a user and called them entitled and bratty i was explaining that the comment wasnt about an actual person or user it was a hypothetical individual i wasnt particularly perturbed because i thought you had insulted anyone specific here is you calling a woman who lives her life differently from the way you do a self importantbrat you were annoyed you thought the statement proved i was an intolerant mean person since that person didnt exist and i wasnt being intolerant of the actual user and that user agreed with me overall it was just on one particular topic we had different viewsyour assertion was wrong and misleading from the start but there is clearly a lot of disgust for those who do not want that style of relationship especially when they come to the sub and start telling us that were all abused idiotic helpless sockpuppets you talk as though its not acceptable to have opinions you disagree with i dislike a lot of things as do you i dont care what anyone does in terms of their relationship i left the rpw sub largely for this reason i originally signed up to get some good advice on being a good subservient gf and found myself in a womanbashing fingerpointing party again noped the hell out of there again if you can provide links so that i can look over the exchange then i can offer my perspective and insight otherwise i can only say that im sorry you felt attacked rpw is a community i care about i wont apologize for my opinion i would never expect or ask you to so at least we agree on one thing 0 edit formatting spelling\n",

      "anecdotally speaking i was fully aware of my gender identity and gender dysphoria by at least 68 years old perhaps earlier as those are some of my earliest memories i indeed later transitioned as an adult in terms of the actual science it shows that theres quite a bit of nontrans gendernonconforming children who do so as a type of play those kids grow out of gender nonconformity by age 12 while trans kids continue to do so gender identity is formed in the womb theres neurological differences between trans and cis people and the sense of gender identity appears to form at about the age of 35 so in that sense if youre following science you should accept that people can come out as trans as early as 3 years old as for sexuality im not too wellversed on that and have had a hell of a time even now id imagine that its a similar boat a frombirth thing with kids realizing it at around a specific time maybe at puberty or a little before but theres no reason to assume a teenager cant figure out theyre gay if a kid can figure out theyre straight they can figure out that theyre not straight its not a choice i dont think that kids have gained enough social experience to place themselves in a gender category for example a boy may enjoy playing dolls with his female peers but also enjoy playing baseball with his male peers this is not what being trans is personally as a kid i had mixed interests but leaned malemasculine despite being a trans girl i think most can remember times we did things in our early childhood that would be contrary to our current gender identity not really if anything my entire life has just been event after event that makes things awkward about gendersex and constantly wondering why i didnt feel like a guys or why i was so drawn to being a girl while you may have done some stuff that diverges from your gender to imply thats all trans people are is disingenuous though in hopes of finding some middle ground i will agree that gender dysphoria heavily increases during puberty and adolescence as well as early adulthood these are the times that trans people most often kill themselves due to dysphoria whereas in childhood due to androgyny lack of developmental hormones etc its generally not as pronounced this is why kids who assertively come out during childhood are rare most people come out during their teens or during early adulthood the same it appears goes for gay people however just because these things are more noticeable in adolescence doesnt mean that thats when they developed it makes sense that once a larger focus on gendersexuality happens that the problems in that area are revealed\n",

      "the chromosome is where hard wire sex comes in this is false this is directly demonstrable and is the basis of far more scientific studies than have been done regarding whether someone is trans or not therefore since you cling to trans science it seems you should cling to this even more im confused youre saying trans people have chromosomes of the opposite sex or that trans people have chromosome disorders i believe that the brain changes according to your will unfortunately this isnt true if you take ssris you stop being depressed if you shoot up dopamine your mood changes if you take sex hormones that dont match your brains sex you get gender dysphoria to say these arent true is to entirely ignore neuroscience youre effectively saying being gay is a choice this is why depressed people have brain changes and i may just argue that almost all illnesses arise from this issue the conscious mind lying to the subconsciousthis changes the structure youre saying that people are imagining they have mental illness what the fuck that guys with pfs are just making it up thats some serious antiscience beliefs there is wiring for age actually you can find that yourself is there link afaik the only difference is how developed the brain is not an actual internal timer that identifies how old the body is i did basically didnt i not even close yes because the y chromosome nope if this were the case every trans person would have that same reaction they dont most of the time its the exact opposite brain fog clears they are no longer depressed or have anxiety theyre elated more functional people etc the only way your theory would hold is if every trans person had the opposite sex chromosomes at which point wouldnt they already be the opposite sex you really dont see the difference between someone who was born xx no penis as is natural or xy penis cut off well for starters trans women dont get their penis cut off youre thinking of nullos who are still men trans women have it converted into a vagina also worth noting there are people with xx chromosomes with a natural penis and people with xy chromosomes without one but lastly yes i dont see the difference at most i see a difference in chromosomes but you still forgot to account for the tons of variations he was forced to be a girl and didnt know his identity nature worked its course if he didnt know his identity and gender identity isnt an actual thing he shouldve embraced being a girl the fact that he didnt demonstrates that gender identity is an actual thing and bad stuff happens when its not aligned trans people some kind of cognitive dissonance for some reason mixes with the utter unleashing of the pandoras box that is the irrational human mind this is what i argue how do you account for the inverse reactions to hormones trans people have negative results on their birth sex hormones and positive on their transitioned sex hormones cis people are the opposite positive on birth sex hormones negative on transitioned sex hormones this alone seems to debunk your hypothesis also trans people dont have cognitive dissonance they have gender dysphoria theyre clearly aware of the situation unlike say anorexia see above this is a silly argument its not though i cannot see with my eyes someones chromosomes yet you say thats the only way to know their sex so i cannot gender them properly until i see the results of that test if he has an age specific mind which could be he is a little girl by your definition i want to see you either say it or deny this with a good reason yes if age specific minds in terms of identity are a thing and a person clearly has an age identity that differs from their body id agree they are that age stuck in an inappropriately aged body that logic must follow thats not to say their body is such just that they as a person are and are stuck with a body that does not match who they are purely hypothetical he does have an age specific mind is he actually 6 years old only if he transitioned to be 6 as well otherwise you have a 6 year old mind with an adult body say it or contradict yourself no contradiction im not claiming pretransition trans people are the sex that their brain is likewise a pretransition transage person is not the age their brain is once you transition then yes they are even if that transition isnt 100 perfect google it i cant find any links on people having the brain of a god hell i cant even find any proof that there is even a god in the first place let alone a person with the brain of one yep proof links im really curious how do you know that its a god brain did you have a god and open them up and look at their brain consider me skeptical wow youre the first person to actually not deny this contradiction what contradiction if you have the brain of a god youre a god in a mans body i just doubt the possibility that a human brain would naturally result in the brain of a god given i doubt the existence of gods usually they give me some completely arbitrary reason as to why it cannot be why cant it be if there are gods and those gods have brains and there are people with brains that match the brain of a god then certainly that person is a god despite having a human body it logically follows i just doubt that theres gods that gods have brains and that people have a brain that matches those nonexistent god brains and so the more likely reality is that someones delusional or has an egotistical personality disorder its already been published link theres a published proof of god color me skeptical oh so thats a delusion and being trans isnt yes weve already been over this trans people have brains that match the opposite sex this is backed by the effects of sexed hormones on trans vs cis people the other is clearly a personality disorder or delusion since gods do not exist and humans do not have a brain of a god man does that sound completely arbitrary blame science and how brains naturally work youll probably be surprised that theres no part of the brain that determines whether you can photosynthesize and if youre a plant brains are naturally humanoriented like that im surprised you dont know this says mr men dont have xy pairs youre such a hypocrite haha you were saying it just blows my mind you actually believe a trans person can actually change sex it blows my mind that someone can completely change sex and youll deny it on principle ok so he is not a guy nah i lied again thats actually a cis dude this is so much fun you cant even fucking tell tell me oh wise one is that a guy or a girl cis guy trans guy trans girl or cis girl do you even know i thought the difference between men and women was so clear without chromosome testing when i dress up as a chick and i do i am not a girl even though people cant tell you pass without taking any hormones somehow i doubt that you must be a very feminine dude but yes if you present female pass as female and identify as female i have no problem calling you such which is why i still call drag queens female theyre dudes but in drag theyre female however with no hormones you still have a male body your little test is bogus and you know it not really you pass take hormones and identify as female theres not really much else to go on i doubt you do any of the three its weird you say that considering you argued against this in the past did i i simply said crossdressers arent trans not that they cant present female you seem confused here so let me explain lots of people tend to get tripped up on this theres a few different things you can label female theres how you present theres your body and then theres your brain all youre saying is that you present female still have male body and still have a male brain in that case id say that youre male but in conversation and while youre presenting ill say sheher or more clearly youre a male presenting as a female to relate to trans people trans people may present as malefemale have a malefemale body and have a female brain same thing applies they could be a female with a male body and be presenting male standard guy with gender identity issues they could be a female with a male body and presenting female much like how you are when crossdressing and presenting female this how some trans women are for a long time if they cant get on hormones or they could be female have a female body hormonestransition and present female for reference the guy in the picture presents male and has a male body we cannot be sure what his brain says but given thats buck angel hes a trans dude so male brain as well and to be clear you can choose how you present you can change your body but at the moment your brain is stuck\n",

      "right because she was an empowered woman in 1995 how scandalous people in my generation really forget how far the perception of women has come in the years weve been alive ive had a lot of people again millennials try and tell me that hillary being a woman isnt important to this election but to me it seems that aspect of her has defined everything about how she is portrayed and how the media treats her and therefore how the public perceives of her most of the blind hatred comes from a position of sexism in my opinion and that doesnt mean that the people repeating it are sexist it just means theyre vastly unaware of the context in which those attacks began i wish it wasnt true either but thats the reality and trying to remove that aspect from her candidacy is ignoring so much context i absolutely blame bernie supporters who are refusing to vote for hillary at this point now theyre just repeating back irrational hate without thinking about its origin which again i would tell people about except they get offended and think im accusing them of sexism and since im a woman im voting with my vagina and all and that whole attitude of if i cant get what i want then america can burn is so damn privileged like sure throw all of our mexican and muslim citizens under the bus and put them at risk of actually losing their rights as citizens just because you didnt want to vote for an incredibly qualified candidate who has made a few mistakes thats fair and voting 3rd party is basically voting for trump at this point which in other elections i would care less about but to say that trump is just as bad as any other republican candidate no if you have any historical context for our nations political system you are objectively wrong bernie got the sweetest deal of anyone out of the primary for sure dude went from a fairly obsolete senator who as far as i can tell has never really accomplished anything to a national hero it was a brilliant move on his part i like bernie alright but i always supported clinton because her policy plans were much more comprehensive then i started to grow wary of the sentiment he was stirring up among people my age where hillary was seen by many as a nonviable candidate what and now i see i was right to be worried hes completely lost control of a decent chunk of supporters and i dont think he knew that was coming clearly these politicians are not on reddit enough haha i agree that trump is a genuine threat to our democratic system the part that gets me the most terrified is his actual complacency about hate crimes and beating up those who disagree with him im not sure people are fully understanding the gravity of that like if george down the street hates mexican immigrants then whatever george but if he beats up a mexican guy you know hell be prosecuted and punished in the meantime a few trump supporters did beat up a mexican guy and he responded well theyre passionate if our nations president and highest authority refuses to speak out against actual hate crimes that is a really really terrifying road in normal circumstances suggesting something like that would feel like the slippery slope but trump has already refused to speak out against violence so its just actual reality something tells me it seriously strokes trumps ego to know that his supporters beat people up in his name then theres also his aversion to freedom of the press because he cant handle criticism against himself and him being distinctly against free speech that doesnt agree with himthe greatest con hes pulled this election was convincing people that he is the candidate of free speech when really he only accepts speech that supports his ideals not to mention the international consequences of electing trump not least of which is putins desired invasion of eastern europe and the possible start of ww3 the bulwarks against him unfortunately are a the people who are being idiots right now ive heard some people say to me well if trump gets in power how much could he really do itd be limited by the system hi were in a democracy you are limit 1 b the republican party who failed to stop his nomination at the convention c the legislative branch with mr doormat paul ryan in command and a republicandominated congress great d the supreme court where we still do not have a 9th justice so he would be on trumps side and the other 4 conservative justices are like 96 years old and likely agree that america is going downhill if it came to impeachment he would probably survive it based on the current government therefore i see no reason to believe that trumps power would be checked once he gets to the white house especially because he surrounds himself with people who always agree with him his advisers arent going to stop him from doing anything because they will all be yes men im hoping to start working in hong kong soon as im living in china now but a part of me is tempted to drop everything and work for hillary until the election instead because i seriously do believe this is a pivotal turning point in the future of our country after seeing brexit happen i believe nothing is impossible\n",

      "enfps are special even when they do not feel special two quotes from different sources but they ultimately mean the same thing 1 who can gaze into the mirror without becoming evil the mirror does not reflect evil but creates it 2 you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life what these two quotes mean is if you look for imperfections in life you will always find imperfections for that is what you are looking for and the human will start to shape your perception of what you are looking for and will create imaginary lines around an object and once the lines are vivid enough in your imagination you will categorize and limit a far more complicated thing thus when you gaze but another word for gaze is stare into a mirror you will find evil if your goal is to search for evil and if you stare into the mirror looking for good you will find good thus the mirror itself is not the evil or good thing but instead just a way for human beings with our minds eye to find what the mind is able to create the mind itself is the infinite vessel it is the object of creation here is a westworld video clip on this subject with minor spoilers for this seasons finale but its been edited so the spoilers are minor the sistine chapel and how truth can have multiple layers of truth it is only 30 seconds long the second quote is effectively the same as the first quote but it is also different let me explain the first quote is talking about human beings ability to create imaginary lines and categorize stuff and assign magical names to stuff and this can limit a more complicated thing but human beings ability to create imaginary lines are also limited for human beings are limited we are often wrong with our analysis for we are existential beings if we never experienced something how can we have a word for it how can we understand an ideal if we never encountered it before the only way to encounter something new is to be open to new things to not put imaginary lines around stuff and thus limit our ability to understand to not search for stuff in our perception but to be mindful and to have a heart of a child and always be growing and willing to learn about new things thus happiness is one of these things we may have seen shadows of happiness in our lives before now but that is not happiness in its entirety but instead pale imitations of its true form it is like being a blind man and only able to experience the world through touch and sound and taste if you were to touch an elephant your idea of what an elephants truely is is dependent on where you touched it did you touch its trunk its legs its tail its ivory tusk if you were to listen to an elephant you can hear very social creatures who are loving mothers and fathers but also elephants who take care of the rest of the herd but if you were to listen to an elephant during other moments of an elephants life you can hear a very angry and intense animal who will seem very threatening and very destructive when the elephant is trying to defend something or the elephant is scared here is a quote from the last chapter of the counte of monte cristo i am going to be editing it to remove spoilers but also to emphasize some of the meaning i am trying to convey by removing some plot events from the quote and instead go to the higher meaning the events are trying to convey aka what is the moral the aesop of the quote tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny to pray sometimes for a single man a being of mankind who like satan thought himself for an instant equal to god but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart as for you this is the secret of my conduct towards you there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness we must have felt what it is to die that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope enfps do you ever feel special selfenfp im ready to go to bed and im just thinking when do i feel like me as a whole is wonderful human wisdom is not drawing lines it is not classifying things as you are a special human being and these are non special human beings human beings wisdom is to wait and to hope to be a young child who is always filled with wonder for they are now able to see magic in their lives in a way a baby or toddler can not understand magic to not become a cynical adult who is convinced of their own logic and higher being so much that they see the world as concrete instead of magical no human wisdom is to understand this world is magic to understand human beings are capable of using this magic but we will never master the magic completely to be the young child who is in wonder with this world for they are just starting to learn while maintaining they will never complete the journey aka to wait while to maintain the ultimate youth of a baby of toddler the one who is so suprised by peek a boo the laugh of a baby this is hope which is a form of faith without preconceived rules on what faith should be that is what hope elipis the greek word for hope truely is to not become an adult the greek word for hope is elipis which means to hope but also to be welcome and open to what is about to come another word related to elipis is the word ellipsis which are those magical three dots which mean to fall short to show something is incomplete well true human wisdom is to understand that the incompleteness should not be a source of pain or you feeling rejected or disappointed but instead something that should feel you with hope just because you do not see a completed item you should still believe in magic and clap your hands for life is not ended happiness is not a destination but instead a journey and your journey to that dark tower in the middle of the desert is not complete so do not despair but instead fill yourself with wonder and counsel yourself with waiting and hoping\n",

was talking about myself and thats simply not the case but still lets assume thats true even if someone who loses their job could find a new one right away theyre still looking at at least three weeks before they get a paycheck unemployment in many places takes several weeks to process the first check hell in my state if you dont work at least 40hours a week at the federal minimum wage you wont qualify for unemployment at all which is no accident thats how it calculates exactly ive been unemployed for months at a time as have many people obviously but ive never gotten unemployment all it takes for some people is one or two financial setbacks in a row and the paychecktopaycheck deck of cards theyre playing with comes crashing down lose job car breaks down no money and no familyfriends have the funds to help what then its not all environmental people can be generally incompetent and undriven which lowers the threshold of hardship needed to tilt their life i believe if i were less resilient or not as gifted with intelligence i would have probably ended up in a way worse situation its of course hard to imagine since imagining oneself unable to think about things as one does currently is difficult a person whos managing a mental illness loses their health insurance can no longer afford the medication they need to function a family falls behind on their mortgage or hell the bank fucks up and their house is erroneously foreclosed on and they lose their home the list goes on im not and have not denied that life deals shit hands my point is not everyone has a support network to help them when shit like that happens to them i have never thought that was true i personally have nothing and no one currently im renting a car for 500 month because i cant afford to buy one and no ones perfect people make poor choices here or there that contribute to things falling apart but the consequences can be so drastic and the struggles so alien and unfathomable to many people who dont understand it that their plights go largely unnoticed losing a job at the wrong time can have drastic consequences for people depending on other factors in their lives i dont deny this i actually am sorry i came across as rude and judgmental as i did but damn well thank you you sound really sincere and uniquely open to really listening to what im saying for the average redditordiscussingpolitics your comments really seem to indicate that you 100 blame the people who begin drowning in life or get nudged overboard by circumstances or the system for not being able to immediately right the ship in time it read like you dont understand how that could be a stability and security destroying event for a person because your own experiences didnt affect you in that way well i did it so anyone anywhere can bootstraps just so callous where which specific sentences if you dont mind either way i may have overreacted reacted in my comment to you however i want to askif you were really and truly offended by it im not sure how to define offense but i wasnt terribly bothered once people start down voting the reactions i expect to continue to come in arent particularly surprising but yours is solely for the fact that youre not jumping in and critiquing in a guaranteed safe space due to all the people implicitly voicing agreement with you via downvotes for me is there a chance that even a small part of you reacted defensively to me holding up a mirror i dont think so anyone who really knows me not reddit doesnt doubt the degree of self reflection i do i literally just had a very long discussion last night about the social mechanics of compassion and what right kindness looks like whether it should be sought and how it should be shown i know i personally am lacking in empathy and compassion when compared to how i was when i was younger and i am seeking to change that that however is regarding my interpersonal relationships 1 on 1 i dont feel like i am failing to exhibit the compassion and empathy on a wide scale sociological lyrics i have an enormous amount of understanding for the financially disadvantaged but unless i am explicitly and only expressing sympathy people on reddit generally dont want to hear it personal responsibility is difficult to express popularly unless its less that a quarter of your point as it is yours that doesnt make what i believe invalid but in this thread you alone genuinely sought to determine if there was any more depth to my views im not a fan of welfare and entitlement programs etc etc but its not in disregard of the poor much the contrary i believe its ana actual harm to the overall well being and flourishing of society to engage in them but i havent pretended to have a cohesive and airtight political philosophy since i was a teenager i dont have the answers just cuz im conservative doesnt make me a republican we all have our biases and prejudices i know i certainly do i try to work on them and i can be unkind so if i was unkind to you i apologize i could have come at things in a different way you were not unkind to me in context perhaps you were not as kind as you could have been but thats a standard higher than i see anyone else holding anyone else on reddit to much less themselves so no hard feelings in any event you sound like an incredibly interesting person to hang out with as you are at once deeply empathetic and intellectual so dont let reddit jade you\n",

      "alright im back sorry i took so long was helping a buddy move house contraception is unnecessary if the babies you have are the ones that you planned for wholeheartedly agree with ya it is not the only method for planning children for sure i view this topic from a strictly natural standpoint being that it is a natural biological process i agree with the fact that its a biological process but its not the process i have an issue with its the consequences of that process specifically the negative ones without machines manufacturing artificial contraceptives we are only left with a few options have sex cautiously and be careful to plan for the possibility of a child or have sex carelessly and plan for any children that result from it this ignores two facts 1 some people dont want children and 2 even people who do want children arent necessarily prepared financially emotionally etc for that kind of commitment heck we know that married twoparent households are the best environment for raising kids but we also know that the marriage rate of the united states is steadily declining and that twoparent households are at an alltime low taken together all this shows that we need to reduce the number of children born to people unsuited to caring for them the simplest and most effective way of achieving that goal is definitely via contraception and allowing access to abortions heck we know that allowing access to bc in itself lowers abortion rates and that the rhythm method the most natural available method of birth control does not work remotely as well as other contraceptives my theory is that people will naturally get better at tuning themselves to not have children but having zero children is not very likely unless youre doing the specific action that makes them correct me if im wrong here but your hypothesis is reducing access to birth control and abortion will lower the number of unwanted pregnancies heres the thing though red states the south in particular that oppose abortion rights and also contraception have higher rates of unwanted pregnancies when i said take a pill i was specifically referring to the pill being that men have condoms as their only option and neither side prefers to use them granting that men and women despise using condoms there are plenty of other contraceptives that are available for use and the united states steadily declining birth rate is evidence that americans are a having less sex b being more responsible about the sex theyre having or c both of the above if we assume all the bitching about people having more sex than ever is true then that means people are actually being more responsible about sex when birth control is available being responsible sometimes means that well have to think about that stuff yes its an option im not denying that its an option im saying its an ineffective option compared with condoms iuds and progestin implantsinjections neither does the pill condoms are the only one i know of that do that agreed i dont think nature gives most life forms a choice in reproduction otherwise we wouldve gone extinct a long time ago hm this is an appeal to nature fallacy and renders your argument invalid overreliance on birth control or other safety measures or devices enables people toward a tendency to develop irresponsible attitudes and behaviors as well as a false sense of security well the sti rate in the us has spiked recently so theres some good support for your assertion but considering that the us birth rate has hit an alltime low its not fair to say that contraceptives havent been doing their job what you guys need right now is better healthcare but considering what the president has proposed gigantic cuts to healthcare i think youre in for one of the worst healthcare crises the world will see in a long time and it distorts reality by leading them to believe that sex and pregnancy are somehow separate from each other they are two gay men having sex cant get each other pregnant no matter how hard they try were not reptilians goodnight and sleep well checks watch 220 am well that wraps up my reply to you do reply as im still interested in seeing your pov on this till then take care buddy see ya soon\n",

      "are people fucking retarded first and most importantly there is an incredible deficit of globally minded engineers in america and other western countries i used to participate in a little organization called iaeste youre still a student find the chapter at your campus and join it if your university doesnt have one start one that is an internship exchange program for students in technical majors every year i would go out to recruit people for membership to our chapter and espouse awesome benefits like free travel to conferences in the us free tshirts free pizza awesome parties and of course the meat of the organization internships in a country of your choosing where you get paid to work abroad all i would get are blank looks back engineers are very cliche when it comes to being social and outgoing and the same standard applies to wanting to travel abroad putting themselves out there learning a new language and interacting with people from another culture in fact i could probably say within 10 accuracy that 70 of our members were science or architecture majors or from some fringe engineering like biomedical eng youre a mechanical engineer and youre interested in another country being in compsci and liking japan doesnt count and want to learn the language you are a fucking prize my friend thats point one point two is about russian russia despite its secondary role in the world these days is an engineering power house its one of three three countries in the world that can send people into space ignoring americas brief hiatus yes its riding on its own coattails at this point as far as the aviation sector goes but it still produces some of the worlds top engineering products im not saying you would or should ever work for a russian engineering company but if the company you do work for ever needs to work with the russians on something or modify one of russias planes for an experimental project which a company i worked for was about to do in the final runnings for the x55 you will be the project managers best friend communication is key in any environment and theres nothing that can raise more tension than a group of professionals that are feeling very awkward around each other because even if they know each others language they feel too unsure about which jokes are appopriate how they may offend one another how the food the visiting group is eating is just too much unlike whats at home etc etc etc and even if you never end up working with international groups or on russias products i can guarantee you that you will never meet a russian engineer at least one that graduated before the collapse of the ussr that you wont be impressed by the ussr never really produced anything amazing outside of the defense sector but they still have some pretty talented engineers theres nothing like working with one of those guys on a project and you wont find an engineering company in the us without at least one or one from the cis anyways people are telling you german would be a better option why because they make nice cars and have a lot of engineering business fuck german what whoever told you that forgets is that most germans already know english as do most french people czechs koreans and definitely indians and hell if you really needed to learn german for your job you could pick it up in a couple of weeks its basically already english minus a few hundred variations on the words the and a russian meanwhile doesnt even have articles nobody will ever hire you because of the perk of knowing german how do i know i know because i know german learning russian and learning it well is hard its notorious for it theres way more exceptions than there are rules you have to learn a new alphabet therere a bunch of expressions that are inherently part of the language that you would never know from simply learning russian if you do this people will notice that aside whatll really seal the deal on being an international engineer is either going on an internship in russiaukrainebelarus or working there for a little bit hell working in any country abroad with a different language a russian minor is all well and good but theres nothing quite like saying you went to moscow or spb where the signs are filled with weird squiglies lived there for 4 months and worked in an industry that has its own dictionary with words that even the locals sometimes dont know it shows experience flexibility cultural diversity and polymathic tendencies most people wouldnt be surprised if you also were to mention that youre a world renowned cellist on the side and can make a pretty mean ragu too anyways to tldr this learning any new language is impressive for an engineer but its more important to work a little abroad if its from a career standpoint russian is an excellent choice because it has a rich engineering history it shows an ability to do something hard that engineers usually cant and its likely itll involve some awesome traveling in your job as an engineer to russia or otherwise edit thank you for my first gold rrussian i guess it hit home with more people than i thought\n",

      "all in all the reason protestants read the bible more than us is because bible study is way more ingrained in their traditions for catholics to be more interested in reading the bible as a whole bible study needs to become a tradition and not just an activity in my opinion as a former evangelical i think the whole thing hinges on the fact that for protestants the worship basically revolves around assembling for a bible study on sundays whereas for us catholics our worship centers around communing with the lord through the holy eucharist not to disparage scripture at all but for most protestants the bible is as good as its going to get for them and their worship for us catholics we have the flesh and blood of christ himself as the focal point of our worship so to me protestants spend more time reading the bible because they dont have access to the eucharist they cant receive christ they cantwontdont spend time in adoration because they cant even perceive such a thing as long as they maintain their protestant beliefs\n",
